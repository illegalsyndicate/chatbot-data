Features & Enhancements
This section of the release notes provides details of new features and enhancements in the HyWorks v3.4-GA release.

New Feature Integrations
Changes in HyWorks
Session Host IP Virtualization for both Linux and Windows-based Session Host Servers
HyWorks v3.4 has an integration for the virtual IP address feature for multi-user Windows and Linux session host servers. This feature provides a unique IP address to each session on the session host server. The virtual IP helps in identifying separate users on the network that are all working from the same session host server.

This feature is configured through the HyWorks Controller Management Console.
This feature is supported by both Linux and Windows session host servers for shared hosted desktop and application sessions.
Virtual IP can be applied to all or to specific processes.
Administrators can choose to block the session if the virtual IP address is not available (by providing a session only when the virtual IP is available).
Virtual IPs can be temporarily or permanently assigned.
Session Recording
HyWorks v3.4 has a feature that will enable recording of sessions on shared session hosts or on personal virtual desktops. This feature can be configured using the recording profile in the HyWorks Management Console. All the recorded sessions will be listed within and can be viewed through the HyWorks Management Console.

The following controls are provided for session recording:

An option to enable or disable session recording for a specific pool, applications or users. Recording profiles are attached to HyWorks connection profiles.
An option to record only at specific intervals, at the start of a session, for a specific network IP address or at the launch of a specific application/process.
Provide sessions only when recording is possible.
An option to pause recording if the user session is found inactive for the configured minutes.
Support for MP4 and MKV formats.
Options to control framerate, recording visual (Black & White or Color), resolution (800x600 to 3840x2160), enable or disable transcription.
Controllable recording upload time.
A new system role 'Recording Auditor' has been added. Users that have a Recording Auditor role will be able to view and play recordings through the HyWorks Management Console.
Nutanix Flow Integration
Nutanix Prism Central provides an option to assign categories to different VMs. It delivers advanced network security, providing visibility into the virtual network, application-centric protection from network threats, malware, ransomware and security and compliance monitoring.

HyWorks v3.4 has an integration for the Nutanix flow, where administrators can choose to apply categories to desktop pools or desktop VMs. This will enable organizations to deploy software-defined virtual network security without the complexity of installing and managing additional products that have separate management and independent software maintenance requirements.

Integration of new cloud providers - Oracle and AWS (Amazon Web Services)
HyWorks v3.4 has integrated support for Oracle and AWS cloud service providers. Currently these providers are in Beta phase.

The integration has also been extended to HyLabs.

Support for New Linux Flavors
HyWorks v3.4 has support for new Linux OS flavors:

Red Hat Enterprize Linux v7.9
Ubuntu Boss v8
Ubuntu Gnome 20.04
User Logon using Random Password
In a workgroup environment, HyWorks can be used to provide session connection with a randomly generated password at all times. The feature will ensure:

Passwords are being generated randomly during connection
Administrators will not have access to user passwords in the HyWorks built-in directory
Site configurations and desktop pool DC-DR support
HyWorks v3.4 will provide an option to define sites through the Management Console. Desktop pools can be configured to provide access to local or remote sites. A desktop pool configured for remote site will remain inaccessible until the administrator triggers disaster recovery for the remote site. Once DR is activated, all desktop pools configured for the remote site will become accessible.

Option to make provisioned desktops members of AD group(s)
On the Desktop Pool wizard -> Customization screen, the option to mention AD groups has been provided. As part of the system customization process, the new computer object will be made a member of the AD groups mentioned here.

Installer - Session Host Installer is removed from the Controller Setup
In earlier versions of HyWorks Controllers, the Controller setup had an option to install the session host servers. With v3.4, session host servers will be installed using a separate installer.

Option to Choose Datastore Cluster (VMware) for Deployment
v3.4 of HyWorks Controller is enhancing the support for VMware object hierarchy. Earlier versions did not have the option to choose a Datastore cluster object. In v3.4, Datastore cluster objects will be shown and will be selectable through the HyWorks Management Console.

Integration of the Diagnostic Tool
The diagnostic tool can help with diagnosing problems with the system (HyWorks Controller/Session Host/Desktop VM) by evaluating overall configurations, service and system status. The diagnostic tool will also collect all system information needed by the support team that is normally asked to the customer, such as the product version, operating system etc.

v3.4 of HyWorks has an integrated diagnostic tool, which can be run through the HyWorks Controller Management Console if the agent on the target system (Session Host/ Desktop VM/HyWorks Controller) can be contacted. If this option is not working, the tool can also be located at the following location:

HyWorks Controller: \<Controller Installation Directory>/Service/DiagnosticsTool
HyWorks Session Host (Windows): \<Session Host Installation Directory>/SessionHost/DiagnosticsTool
HyWorks Desktop VM (Windows): \<DVM Tools Installation Directory>/HyWorks Desktop Agent/DiagnosticsTool
Configurable Behavior for Domain De-registration of Provisioned VMs on Recompose
The previous version of HyWorks Controller was trying to deregister provisioned VM entries from all discoverable DCs. For small deployments, this worked but for large deployments with too many DCs, the deregister calls were taking too much time, failing for unreachable DCs and also causing some conflicting results. To improve this behavior, the following configurable advanced settings have been provided:

Remove the VM from the domain controller option: Set this option as 1 to remove the VM from all discoverable domains, and set it as 2 to remove from specified domain controllers
Un-register machine from domain option: Set as 0 to disable, set as 1 for "only during pool or VM destroy (delete from disk)", and set as 2 for "unregister on VM delete (during Pool delete and in recompose/recreate)"
Domain name list to remove desktop: if the "Remove VM From Domain Controller Type" option is set to 2 (delete only Specified Domain Controller), then specified domain names will be used. This field accepts comma separated values to mention multiple DCs.
HyWorks Controller Management Console Login via HySecure SAML App
Latest HyWorks Controller supports logging into the Management Console via SAML from HySecure. This will require the latest HySecure release which has the required changes to support this feature.

The feature will be controlled via the Advance Configurations tab:

Management Console login Option: Set as 0 for "HyWorks Portal only", set as 1 for "Saml only" and set as 2 for "HyWorks Portal and SAML".
SAML-IDP Endpoint URL: URL for the application configured on IDP, Management console send SAML request for authentication.
SAML-Certificate: SAML certificate is used to validate SAML response.
SAML- Assertion Consumer Service Url: The ACS URL is an endpoint on the Management Console that the identity provider will redirect to with its authentication response.
SAML Group Attribute name: Attribute name for the group in SAML response
SAML- Issue URL: Issuer URL - Unique identifier of the IdP. Formatted as a URL containing information about the IDP so the SP can validate that the SAML assertions it receives are issued from the correct IDP.
Changes in HyWorks Management Console
HyWorks Management Console Revamp
The HyWorks Management Console is completely refurbished to make it easy to use. The changes include:

Grouping menus in a better and more logical way
Arranging menus in three levels
Themes and colors for better appearance
Separating Session Servers and connectors for easy management and visualization
Renaming of some objects and controls for better understanding such as Session Providers are renamed to Connectors
Old VIP configurations are removed from the Session provider's Add/Edit wizard. With new implementations, VIP settings are applied on Session teams and Desktop Pools/Apps.
Client group menu is renamed to Classification Rules
New Screen to View Recorded Sessions
A new screen (Monitor - Session Recordings) has been added where administrators will be able to view and play recorded sessions.

Run Diagnostic Tool from the Management Console
The HyWorks Management Console will have option to run the diagnostic tool on the following registered objects:

HyWorks Controllers: Management Console -> System -> Controllers -> Select HyWorks Controller -> Troubleshoot
HyWorks Session Host: Management Console -> VDI -> Session Servers -> Servers -> Select Session Host Server -> Troubleshoot
HyWorks Desktop VM: Management Console -> VDI -> VM -> Select VM -> Troubleshoot
New Option in Connection Profiles
The following new options have been added within the connection profiles:

Local Resources -> Allow RDP Plugins -> Accops Web Request Redirection
Additional Settings -> Session Recording Profile
Access Settings -> Window Client Session Launcher Option (Built-in, Legacy (MSTSC), Windows Desktop Client (MSRDC), PC-over-IP Protocol (PCoIP))
Enhancements in Capacity Plan
Support for DC-DR
Deployments where a shared hosted desktop pool has been configured for a remote site can be configured to have the following configurations:

Minimum % of VMs to be provisioned, when disaster recovery not active: This option will keep a minimum number of VMs provisioned for inactive DR pools.
Minimum powered on VM(%), when disaster recovery not active: This option will keep a minimum number of VMs powered on for inactive DR pools.
With DR activated, the capacity plan will takeover the remaining deployment and session host availability.

On-demand Provisioning and Capacity Management
In the earlier version, the capacity plan was triggered at pre-configured intervals only, even in cases where users were getting onboarded and capacity was not as per the objectives. Enhancements have been made in v3.4, where if users are being connected and if the capacity allows provisioning and readying new session host servers, the plan will be triggered immediately. Users will be notified of a short waiting period as the shared hosted desktops are being readied for them.

Changes in Session Host Servers - Windows
Integration of Latest Sub-modules
The following components have been integrated in HyWorks Session Host:

Option to Remove Computer Object from Specified Domain Controllers
Earlier versions of the HyWorks Desktop Agents were attempting to delete computer object from all discoverable DCs. v3.4-GA Desktop agent has registry based configurations, which can be used to disable computer object deletion completely or remove only from the specified domain controllers.

Registry Location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Accops\DVMAgent\ADVANCE SETTINGS
Registry Key: EnableComputerObjectDeletionFromDC, Value: True or False (If false, objects will not be deleted from DCs)
Registry Key: DeleteFromSpecifiedDC: If set as *, objects will be deleted from all discoverable DCs, Comma separated DCs: Agent will try to delete the computer object from only the specified DCs.
Configurations Optimizations
The following enhancements have been made for the HyWorks Desktop Agent and Session Hosts:

Single Registry Set for External Logging: In earlier versions, the session host and desktop agent were reading information from a different registry locations and may have caused confusion. In this version, there will be a single registry location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Accops\DVMAgent\ADVANCE SETTINGS\EXTERNAL LOG SETTINGS
Re-arrange Registry Keys: Registry-based configurations are grouped in a logical structure:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Accops\DVMAgent: Has global DVM agent configurations
Advance Settings: Common advance configurations
External Log Settings: For external logging configurations

Linux VDI (Session Host/ Personal Desktops)
The following changes are integrated for Linux VDI:

IP Virtualization Integration
New Linux DVM Tools in Linux Session Host Servers has integrated support for VIP feature.

New Linux Flavor Support Added
The following new platforms are supported in HyWorks with this version:

Ubuntu BOSS
RHEL
Ubuntu Gnome 20.04
Enhancing communication between the Controller and the Linux Session Host Servers
In the earlier versions, communication between the controller and the Linux session host server was one sided i.e. from the Controller to the session hosts. Going forward, the session host server (Desktop agent) is sending updates to the HyWorks Controller.

Pre and Post HyPrep Script Execution Support
The earlier version of Linux DVM Tools did not have any pre or post HyPrep script execution support. The latest version of DVM Tools for Linux will have these implementation.

Script Path /etc/edcdvm/linuxDvm/scripts/
Script Names: HyprepPreScript.sh, HyprepPostScript.sh
Pre and Post AppLauncher Script Execution Support
The latest version of DVM Tools for Linux has implementations to support script execution before and after AppLauncher execution.

Script Path: /etc/edcdvm/linuxDVM/scripts
Script Names: AppLauncherPostScript.sh, AppLauncherPreScript.sh
Monitoring Service Integration
The latest version of Linux DVM Tools have monitoring service implementation. This feature integration will help with the following:

Monitoring resource utilization for Linux Session Host servers
Adaptive Load Balancing based on resource utilization
Support for Direct RDP and Console Block
This feature is available for Windows Session Host servers and is implemented in latest version of Linux DVM Tools. Based on the configurations, the Linux session host or personal desktop will now:

Log off any remote desktop sessions taken directly and not via Accops HyWorks Controller
Log off any console session (if enabled)
Accepting Calls from Authorized Controller
This feature is available in Windows Session Host server and DVM Tools from v3.3. V3.4 DVM Tools for Linux will have configuration where, if specified, the DVM agent will accept calls only from specified controllers. Any calls from any other controllers will be rejected.

HyLabs Features and Enhancements
The following new features and enhancements are included in v3.4:

Validating Client Groups on Reservation Connect
In previous versions of HyLabs, the client group validation happened only during user logon. In v3.4, changes are incorporated so that the client groups will be validated on reservation connect operations as well. This change also requires the latest HySecure (HyLite) to share WAN IP with the HyWorks Controller during the "Connect" operation.

Self-study Creation Control
v3.4-GA has an additional layer of control for self-study creation and access:

Creation Control: Users will be evaluated for self-study creation. If the Gold master is restricted, and the user is accessing HyLabs from outside of the permitted client group, he/she will not be allowed to create a self study.
Access Control: When the Gold master is not restricted for creation, users will be able to create a self-study from any location but control can only be provided during access. Access will only be available from specified client groups.
System Level Reservation Limits
In the earlier version, the limits were applied at the Gold master level and there was no cap at the system level. This has been fixed in v3.4-GA, where the following two additional system level limits have been provided in the HyLabs Admin Portal -> Default Reservation Settings:

Max VM Limit in System: Maximum number of VMs can be created in the whole system (across the reservations). Set value as 0 (zero) for an unlimited number of VMs.
Max Active VM Limit in System: Maximum number of active VMs for the whole system (across the reservations). Set value as 0 (zero) for an unlimited number of active VMs.

Bug Fixes
The following bugs have been fixed in the HyWorks v3.4-GA release:

#	Subject
24920	HyWorks does not support the selection of datastore cluster during deployment.
This issue is fixed and v3.4 has an integrated enhancement to select and use the datastore cluster for deployment.
24864	The selected Resource pool gets set to Default when the administrator selects "cluster" or "host" as the target location in provisioning profile.
This behavior is now improved to allow the administrator to select "host" or "cluster" and retain saved configurations.
24851	HyPrint with Linux VDI does not work when being accessed through HyLite.
The issue was due to a flag being sent incorrectly and has been fixed in v3.4-GA.
24716	License utilization limit was not working in case of a named user license.
The issue is fixed and named user licenses will now be used as per the set limits.
24390,
20333	If a Windows Session Host server provisioned via HyWorks was customized using Sysprep, the local administrator user password was getting reset and was not able to take remote of session host server.
This issue has been fixed in v3.4-GA, where in the Management Console, selecting the customization method as Sysprep will require the administrator password to be set.
24388	The Session host server or desktop agent stopped sending logs to the ARS/Syslog server, when the 'Share Client Info' flag was not set within the HyWorks Controller.
The condition has been fixed in v3.4-GA and logs will now be sent correctly to the configured ARS/Syslog server.
24387	When the "Delete the VM after every reservation" run field was set to empty for reservations imported from CSV, the feature was not working.
The empty value will be read as true and the reservations will have 'Delete VM after every reservation' as checked.
24383	Applauncher registry is not getting created on fresh installation of Session Host server and no errors are displayed.
Appropriate logs are created in installer logs and also a warning will be shown on setup wizard for AppLauncher registry creation failure.
24365	Device remained Active for a long time and did not switch to an offline state even though the "Last Seen" field displayed correct information.
This issue was identified for devices where the Active state did not have any sessions. This is fixed in v3.4-GA and devices should now show the status correctly.
24198	A Domain trust issue was observed on the VMs after recompose for deployments that had deployed Active Directory Sites and Services as well as those that had multiple DCs deployed in a single site.
This was due to duplicate actions taken by the Controller and the Desktop Agent for deleting the objects on DCs on recompose. Enhancements have been made and object deletion has been made configurable on the Controller as well as the Desktop Agent for better handling of such cases.
23999	Failed to fetch user entitlements with a 'TimeOut Error' in the Management Console for a large number of user entitlements.
This issue has been fixed in v3.4-GA.
23993	The logs downloaded from the HyWorks Controller Management Console were not in proper order.
This issue is fixed in the latest HyWorks Controller release.
23939	Disabling the "Advance Settings - User Life Span and Device life span" field was not working correctly in disabling the automatic user/device deletion.
Issue is fixed in v3.4-GA.
23894	Shared License Pool limit was set as 0 even when the Unlimited shared license pool usage is enabled for the Default org. This intermittently resulted in failure upon user logon with a license exceed error.
This issue is fixed in v3.4-GA so that at the creation of a new child organization, the default organization settings will not be affected.
23809	A "No desktop found with ID" error was being displayed when the GM that was selected had IPv6 enabled on MS Azure.
Support to handle IPv6 has been added to fix this issue in v3.4-GA.
23703	Call to deregister VM from the domain was not initiating at the Controller for the Hyper-V/SCVMM provider
Support to deregister VMs from the domain has been extended to Hyper-V and SCVMM.
23602	A confusing status message of "Successful" was being shown as a response to the DVM refresh call for VMs not having any IP Address listed.
Behavior has been improved to show an appropriate message for VMs that do not have an IP address.
23376	Cloning was failing when a vSphere user configured in HyWorks did not have adequate permissions to read the Gold master folder information.
Better handling of the issue has been implemented.
23090	HyLabs (Login via HyLite) did not work when the auth domain was configured in HyWorks as "Built-in-Built-in".
This issue is fixed. HyLabs login should now work for built-in-built-in auth domain configuration.
22865	GM connect in HyLabs was not working for Workgroup user.
Issue was associated only with #23090 and is fixed in v3.4-GA.
22019	User authentication to the RMS portal (HyWorks) failed when the authentication server was used through the parent organization.
HyLabs has not been tested in multi-organization environment, but this issue has been fixed to enable HyLabs usage and verification in a multi-organization environment.
21873	Failure to create a non-persistent pool was reported even though a restore point was created. The issue caused a failure for post VM power-on restore point creation.
This issue was fixed in v3.4-GA.
21746	Registered device data was getting lost intermittently after a controller upgrade.
A fix to this issue has been provided in v3.4-GA, where devices will not be deleted post upgrade.
21425	Accelerated networking is not working for cloned VMs on MS Azure, even after the Gold master is set to have accelerated networking.
Network acceleration is now working correctly on cloned VMs with v3.4-GA.
21327	Backup creation failed when the HyWorks database was configured using Windows authentication.
This issue has been fixed in v3.4-GA.
20887	The status message for power operation failure when the Hyper-V was unreachable was not displayed but logs were being created, causing confusion for the administrator about whether the operation was successful or not.
An appropriate error status message is now being shown in v3.4-GA.
20789	A duplicate entry was being created when editing the participant from the participant page.
This issue has been fixed in v3.4-GA.
20770	When removing controllers from HA and then re-adding them to the HA, the entry for the secondary controller was not visible on the primary.
The Controller waits for the sync to complete before adding an entry for the controller. This was failing to happen when the controller had a large amount of data to sync. This issue has been fixed by implementing another thread for adding controllers in primary and secondary respectively.
20712	Duplicate users could be added as participants, causing login failures with a grammatically incorrect error being displayed.
v3.4-GA has a fix for this issue and the error message has been corrected.
20622	In a rare condition, the controller created inumerous VM deletion jobs after the desktop pool recompose and started to respond very slowly.
v3.4-GA has a fix for handling such cases.
20392,
20298	If the administrator added the same user in 2 different groups in the Management Console, it opened in 2 different browser tabs and the user was added to the wrong group.
This issue has been fixed in v3.4-GA.
20335	Logging in with leading spaces before the username resulted in an authorization failure on the HyWorks Controller.
The Controller will be truncating leading or trailing spaces, if any are added by the client.
20185	The user search was not working in the built-in group when the group had 100+ users.
Improvisations have been made in v3.4-GA to handle this issue.
20004	Launching the browser with more than 3 arguments in the application command line was not working.
This issue has been fixed in v3.4-GA.
19995	Snapshot restore was shown as successful but the restore point (Snapshot) was not found on the provider.
It was a rare case, where the HyWorks-managed restore point was deleted by the administrator, but the condition has been handled and an appropriate status and logs will now be shown.
19989	If users continuously connect and reconnect sessions on the Linux SHD server, agent and monitoring service were going into a non-responsive state.
The HyWorks Desktop Agent and Monitoring services have been better equipped for this type of session load.
19980	The Remove button on the 'Entitlement' screen within the Application Edit wizard was not working when more than 1 group was added
It was a UI issue and has been fixed in v3.4-GA.
19918	DVM agent logs were insufficient in analyzing the cause of app/desktop session logout.
Logs before every logout in SHD are being added: e.g. "Logging-Out session as VIP attachment failed for user: {Username} and {wtsId}".
19917	Proper logs were not being displayed within the Desktop Agent when the application was not found at configured path.
Appropriate logs will now be shown within the Linux DVM Agent.
19886	Applauncher.exe was replaced if the sessions were running on the session host server during an upgrade.
Appropriate implementations have been made in v3.4 to handle upgrade cases.
19875	When switching controllers with VIP for controller was enabled, an incorrect mode was sent to the SHD.
This issue has been fixed in v3.4-GA.
19159	The built-in group name was not completely shown even through space to do so was available within the Management Console.
This was a UI issue and has been fixed.
18763	GM connect: Launch URL should have used advance config.
In previous versions, the GM connect launch URL was not configurable. Any changes made to the URL on HyLite was causing issues. GM Connect launch URL can now be configured from the HyWorks Management Console -> Advanced settings.
18681	The Controller was unable to refresh the deployed SHD desktop details from the desktop provider and was marking the VMs as missing.
Improvisations have been made to handle this case and VMs are now being appropriately refreshed.
18621,
18563	A firewall rule was created for the default RDP port 3389 when the customized RDP port was used.
The Desktop agent will now create the firewall rule for the configured RDP port only.
18572	The log deletion thread was running on the session node.
This has been improved in v3.4-GA, session nodes will not delete old logs.
18457	When under load, the broker node details were nullified and it behaved like the primary management node.
This issue has been fixed in v3.4-GA.
18414	Gold master information (CPU, Memory, HDD, OS etc.) were not displayed within the UI.
Fixes have been incorporated in v3.4-GA.
18391	The session host and controller installation logs have been improved to include details of Windows role installation, registry configurations, etc.
17976,
17974	With HyLabs under load, errors (deadlock) occurred on license checking and logout in HyLabs.
Appropriate performance improvements have been incorporated in v3.4-GA to handle these cases.
17860	The entry for an un-managed SHD pool was not removed from the DB after it's deletion, causing the controller to attempt to fetch it's details.
Fixes have been incorporated in v3.4-GA.
17843	Desktop pool cloning was failing on Azure if the desktop prefix name had a space in it
Space handling has been incorporated in v3.4-GA
17106	Recompose was not working due to a failure in the deletion of VMs on Nutanix (the provider became unreachable because of too many shutdown calls at the same time)
Advance configurations have been implemented to handle such cases. Max Concurrent Connection To Provider and Concurrent Operation, values for them can be set to 20 and 5 respectively.

Installation and Upgrade Issues
#	Subject
22548	[Controller Setup] HyWorks Controller sync (For modes with HyWorks managed database availability) will not work, if admin has installed controller with providing database address as localhost. HyWorks installer does not resolve the hostname, when only localhost is provided.
Recommendation: Database address should be provided in hostname\SQL-instance-name or IP Address\SQL-instance name format.
20149, 20147, 20155	[Controller Installer] On un-installation, HyWorks Controller setup leaves the inbound rules in firewall for 1. Accops HyWorks Reservation Management Service (port: 38868), 2. HyWorks License Server (Port: 38867), 3. HyWorks Monitoring Service (Port: 38870) 4. HyWorks Upgrade Service (Port# 38865) 5. HyWorks Management Console (Port# 443) 6. EDC Proxy Server (Port: 38861)
15006	[Controller Setup] Controller installation with SQL 2008 is not supported.
18840	[SRMS Setup] On clicking on Next on Database selection page, it goes into Not-responding state for some time.
Recommendation: Wait for installer to check database configurations.
18289	[Controller Setup] Japanese Sync framework is not getting installed on Japanese Windows Server (Japanese Sync FW is not embedded in installer)
Workaround: Install Japanese Sync Framework separately.
18287	[Controller Setup] Upgrading broker node before Management nodes will result in setup corruption (v3.3-GA-HF4 Multi-node to latest)
Workaround: Restart broker node service after upgrade of all nodes.
18026	[Controller Setup] Restore database option is disabled when database is on some other VM. As controller will not be able to move backup file to SQL Server and thus restore is not supported for configurations having SQL Server is hosted on remote server and not on controller.
Backup can be restored using SQL management studio and then controller service can be started to used backed-up database.
18002	[Controller Setup] Broker node installation will not work if any of management node is not reachable.
Recommendation: Keep management nodes installed, up and reachable, during installation of broker nodes.
15701	[Controller Setup] Controller/SHD installer gets failed, if EDC.Core.dll file and installer setup are kept in the same folder.
Recommendation: Remove edc.core.dll file, if present in same directory where setup file is kept.
15213	On upgrading to v3.3-GA (12803), incorrect RDP port is configured in desktop pool configuration. Incorrect port - 3889; Correct port - 3389.
Impact: The bug can cause connection failures to shared hosted desktops post upgrade.
14599	After upgrading to 3.3 GA, authentication server is not reachable.
Impact: User login failures. HyWorks deployments having AD group as super-administrator, admin login will also fail and whole system may become unaccessible.
Workaround:
Change Active Directory option value to 2 or 3 in database - Table Name: ClusterServerSettingsDbo, Field Name: ADGroupAccess Type, Set Value: 2 or 3 Recommended
Repair HyWorks Controller after upgrade and set super-administrator as local HyWorks user. Login into Management console with new super admin, update Active directory options value to 3 from 6 in System - Advanced Config and save or update authentication server configurations to have base DN and other new mandatory fields.
13918	[Session Host Setup] No error logs are shown, when HyWorks Session Host setup fails to install remote desktop server role and thus administrator can not know, if installation is completed successfully or not.
13778	[Controller Setup] Residual empty License Service and Upgrade service folders are getting created on HyWorks Controller installation.
10107	[Controller Setup] On upgrade or repair, if we go forth and come back, features are getting checked automatically even if they were unchecked.



HyWorks Controller Known Issues
Last Updated Date: 22-Sep-2022
Release: HyWorks v3.4
Note

The Known issues list is updated with every release. This is the current list of known issues.

#	Subject
26215	With deployment settings being kept as default, all the cloned VMs are getting cloned on a single host on which gold master is running, even when the gold master is in cluster.
Workaround: Make sure to specify deployment settings to be deployed at the cluster level.
26042	All the cloned VMs are created on the same storage container as the gold master and not on the specified storage container at the time of cloning with Nutanix.
25836	An incomplete and confusing error is logged in HyWork, when user's attempt to change password fails because of complexity requirements.
25659	Even though User initiates the Power operations on VMs, the log is getting generated again system user in the Controller logs.
25346	Controller continues to show old platform for logged in user and does not refreshes the platform information.
24997	Same users from different authentication server can be added, if configurations are changed in auth-domain, e.g. auth-domain configuration is changed from built-in/built-in to LDAP/built-in or vice versa.
Impact: The duplicate entries may confuse administrator and also may result in login or authorization failures sometimes.
Recommendations: The organization configurations should be planned well so that it does not require change. Even if it needed change, clean-up of HyWorks should be done to remove all users from previous auth-domain configurations.
24885
22968	Oracle Data Disk and OS Disk snapshot is not getting deleted in set time and in case of recompose the old snapshot may be used for provisioning causing the changes done on Gold master to be ignored.
24678	Controller creates an error log if user refreshes the app list on client side and previously some virtual apps in remote app mode are opened and then closed. Error log: No App session found to reconnect for User 'Username'.
24527	In some rare cases VM deletion was failed with error "The Object context instance has been disposed and can no longer be used for operations that require a connection", while deleting the desktop pool.
Workaround: Manually remove the VM from HyWorks and respective provider.
24380	Password change may fail with exception, if port 636 is not reachable from HyWorks Controller or appropriate certificate configurations are not done on active directory server and option 6 is used for active directory connection.
Exception: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host
24373	HyWorks Controller does not log VM image creation on AWS. There is no impact of this but eventually can create some confusion as VM image deletion logs are generated after cloning is completed.
24017	Power operations initiated by client may fail with a non-user friendly exception in multi-node cluster deployment of HyWorks Controller and broker nodes are unable to reach to Microsoft Azure.
Exception: Unable to perform 'Power-on' operation on the desktop [VM-name] for the user 'Username'. More info: Invalid Credentials.
23805	Provisioned SHDs published as physical PCs are not responding without showing error displayed.
The issue is because, all the physical VMs added with same IP address are going to have duplicate IP and in that case controller does not show agent status.
23491	HyWorks may leave some residual data of organization during deletion and may cause complete management console to be inaccessible.
Workaround: Remove the details of deleted organization from database.
23463	Controller uses VM-name to unregister from domain for deployed VMs instead of computer name (Fails in all cases where computer name is different than VM name).
Workaround: Administrators should use same name for fields VM name (Deployment screen) and Computer name (On Customization screen).
23376	Cloning fails when Gold master is created from vSphere server instead of vCenter.
Workaround: Create Gold master VM from vCenter Server wizard.
22148	Sometimes exception on HyWorks Controller is logged after service service restart for stopping scheduler service.
Exception: Cannot stop EDCSchedulerService service on computer '.'. -> System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: The pipe has been ended.
21958	Client entry is not getting updated after updating DN for a user and so multiple client entries are created.
21829	By default for fresh controller installation, with active directory option# 6 for user authentication and authorization, built-in groups and nested groups do not work in HyWorks Controller.
If required it can be changed from HyWorks Controller > Advance Settings.
21731	Controller does not create synchronization logs for a very long period of time when the secondary server with a very large number of records has been added to a controller.
21724	SQL transactions fails on the Controller, when too many devices (100K) are registered.
21287	With small timeouts on HyWorks (< 5 minutes), sessions taken from HyLite may get logged out abruptly though user is working.
This happens because the default sync time between HyLite and Controller is 5 minutes. It is recommended to have timeouts more than 10 minutes, when delivering with HyLite.
21044	Controller access via VIP does not work, if network adapter used for VIP configuration is having space in it.
Workaround: Change network adapter name to have no spaces and same name on both controllers.
20866	Controller sets display name same as username while importing users from LDAP and does not use the actual display name configured on LDAP.
20800	On initiating sync session info action on inactive session provider, controller displays a success status but does not perform any sync operation.
The behavior is also different, when performing the same operation on session team with inactive session provider where appropriate logs will be created.
20733	Active directory server fails to be added into HyWorks, having following policy enabled:
Policy: "Domain controller: LDAP server signing requirements" enabled and configured as "Require signing"
Exception: Additional non-parsable characters are at the end of the string
20616	With too many records for synchronization (more than 100000), cluster configuration fails and primary server may go into fault mode.
Workaround: Create secondary server with backup of primary database and then add to HA, avoiding too much synchronization.
20296	Adding a deployed shared hosted desktop pool creates a team with same name as desktop pool name but updating the desktop pool name does not update the team name.
20202	Network Settings details are not integrated in CSV export from session teams page.
20129
18966	Controller does not support DVM Tools - Lite upgrade.
Provisioned SHDs shown in VMs page can be incorrectly upgraded to DVM tools instead of Lite, because of above issue and may cause functional issues.
20124	Reason of service not responding for Linux session host server is shown as "Feature not available" and may cause little confusion.
20119	If a Windows session host server configured in HyWorks is powered-off, it can create a confusing log.
Log: The Session Provider 'provider name' is not reachable. More Info :Unable to connect to the Session Provider hosted at 'Not Available'. Reason: Unable to parse URI 'http://Not Available, Reason: Invalid URI: The hostname could not be parsed..
20009	In some cases, HyWorks may log an error while deleting desktop pool, though related objects are deleted successfully.
Error: Store update, insert, or delete statement affected an unexpected number of rows (0). Entities may have been modified or deleted since entities were loaded.
19984	Configuring static IP address on Gold master may result in duplicate IPs in the network post provisioning.
19983	Controller may fail to delete a device having associated session and attempts to register into another organization. Ideally Controller should delete the associated sessions also.
19868	The shutdown operation on Linux VMs is kept on hold, if someone has logged-in to the VM from hypervisor console session.
19664	Controller lists all attached VIPs, while trying to change primary IP for the VM. Ideally VIPs should not be listed as they are not always attached to virtual machines.
19560	Saving a session team with a very long range of VIP may get stuck and cause high resource (memory/CPU) utilization by controller service.
Workaround: Create some small network range and configure it on team.
19091	Controller by default uses the primary or first IP on the network interface added on Azure VM, though VM has multiple IP addresses configured on network interface. Option to choose primary IP will not work for Azure provider VMs.
19038	If a permanent VIP is having issue, the user session will be rejected unless the issue is solved or a new VIP is assigned.
18830	Controller may intermittently show error "Error while getting device software information for EDCA00MAC000", causing some confusion.
18507	With too many users connecting a time (more than 10 users per second)
18327	Controller transactions with SQL may get failed with timeout exception if database diagram is created.
Usually database diagram is created when user clicks on it and it checks with user to create it.
18078	In case of domain controllers are deployed in child-parent configuration and HyWorks is configured with child domain, it does not fetch groups or OUs from parent domain controller.
18015	Changes to management are not forbidden from session nodes, so if any deployment is having management console installed on session nodes, changes can be done from session nodes as well.
18006	Controller displays a confusing error invalid username and password, when SAM Account Name is to be used for logon but truncate is off and user is using username@domain-name or domain-name/username to sign-in.
14404	If special characters %/\" are included in Gold Image (Source VM) name or snapshot name for vCenter, snapshot of replica is getting created every time after increasing the count of VM for Persistent pool of type linked clone
Avoid using special characters in Gold Image (Source VM) name or snapshot name.
14376	Incorrect error message is displayed in Test connection of AD, when configured admin account is locked
14375	If the user has changed password, Auth domain (AD/Built-in) and synchronization as Do not create/ Manual, connection to dedicated desktop fails.
14305	[HA] Removal of controller from HA setup leave Tracking Table in DB.
14256	With CredSSP enabled, sessions from Linux based endpoints will fail because of protocol negotiation.
Workaround: Create a separate connection profile for Linux based endpoints.
14083	Deleting a node from HyWorks Controller active-active setup requires node to be destroyed before removal as on service start the node may again get added.
13923	Controller will fail to authenticate users, who are member of "CNF" group in AD.
Exception: XML parsing: line 1, character 1744, illegal xml character.
How is CNF group created: If an object is created on one domain controller and an object with the same name is created in the same container on another domain controller before replication occurs, it creates an object name conflict. Active Directory automatically changes the relative distinguished name of the object with the earlier timestamp to a unique name.
Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/bb727059(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN
13889	Internal configuration is displayed in the error message when user is not able to connect to the AD server.
13767	Even when the single Monitor usage is set in the Endpoint, user is able to use multiple monitors.
13667	User's are not notified about the destruction of desktops they are working on.
13256	Enable DVM reset option is not working for SHD desktop pool due to which snapshot is not created.
13189	User friendly logs are not displayed when controller tries to get the weight of SHD servers which is not in a reachable state.
12972	While performing power operation, internal configuration is displayed in the Controller logs. Due to this, Administrator may not understand which desktop is affected.
12971	Connect desktop logs are not user friendly.
12942	It is not possible to delete vCenter server with 6000 or more VMs.
12871	AD User is not able to log in to client with 256 character length password.
12792	Unpredictable behavior when Round robin load balancing is used with multiple teams.
12564	With UPN as logon attribute, following special characters do not work in username “|\@”`
12561	User, Group or OU with pipe | character is not supported in HyWorks so user logon fails
12547	Fetching OU in entitlements fails if search string includes bracket ( ). Workaround: Search without bracket
12539	If backslash() is included in username, user might have login issues while logging from client using UPN.
12518	Secondary controller hangs and is not able to sync if primary controller is having a large amount of data (1L rows).
12517	Authorization with built-in and nested AD group does not work when Group retrieval type is set to 6 Workaround: Add entitlement using groups created manually and specific groups only.
12458	Desktop provisioning continues even when enough resources are not available on desktop provider (VMware, Nutanix, Azure, Hyper-V).
12439	Unable to delete the AD when reservations created by AD user exists in RMS Workaround: Delete all the associated objects from database before removing AD.
12436	User friendly errors are not logged when cloning fails and Administrator has to check respective Hypervisor or cloud logs.
12434	In many cases, test connection failure may not give detailed exception and thus more analysis of controller/ AD server is required.
12432	Controller fails to fetch OU details if domain name provided in AD configuration is not same as NetBIOS name.
12406	Desktop status is shown incorrectly as Not synced instead of Missing if configured DVM is deleted from the session provider.
12403	Misleading status of desktop VM, when user initiates shutdown internally. HyWorks does not support stop with de-allocation and because power-off is equivalent to stop with de-allocation, incorrect status is displayed.
12402	Status of Desktop agent is Not Responding, when multiple VMs with different IP addresses are present in HyWorks with same IP address.
12399	HyWorks Controller Logs : Username and APPS name is not appearing in Log Details.
12384	Controller Installation on WVD: 1. IIS installation externally (Class not registered) 2. MSMQ installation externally ([RMSBackgroundWorker] while monitoring import events).
12371	[Azure] Log message incorrectly states that recreation of Desktop VM is supported when it is possible to recreate Desktop VMs
12341	Large deployments with 10000 users might fail due to application connection issues.
13334	In User Details, primary AD server details are displayed even when user is authorized from the secondary server.
12328	AD server configuration fails with error "The specified forest does not exist or cannot be contacted." Workaround: Enable Skip attribute verification.
12319	Skip Login Attribute Verification settings is not retained after updating AD server Workaround: Check this configuration every time active directory configuration is updated.
12317	Session nodes logs provide misleading information when management nodes get switched ON.
12187	Incorrect error message shown to user when user account has expired in AD and Group retrieval type is set as '3'
11950	When the Controllers in HA cluster are configured with different ports than information about different ports is not visible on client
Workaround: Use same port for both the Controllers.
11884	Controller installation on other than default port does not get updated in management console configuration. Workaround: Update Management console configuration file to point to modified ports.
11784	[Azure] FQDN of cloned VM not reflecting on desktop VM page.
11780	On user session reconnection (re-login by user), controller may give reconnect of disconnected RDS session with no app running in some rare case, where user has closed the remote app before the disconnection.
11635	Session host server resource data does not get updated in real time and thus with adaptive load balancing server score will be updated after 30 second duration and may cause session from same server for some time until score gets updated.
-	Deleting a node from HyWorks Controller active-active setup will require node to be destroyed before removal as on service start the node may again get added.
11349	External load balancers must use HyWorks health probe service to detect node health, using port reachability may cause failure in detection of node down due to reasons such as licensing or SQL connection issues.
11334	Current weighted round robin does not work in the expected manner and may end up giving more session than expected.
11330	HyWorks uses Least connection load mechanism to serve the session when multiple sessions are requested at the same time. Due to this it might happen that multiple sessions may get served by the same server.
11263	Database gets deleted incorrectly if it is pointed at the time of installing new node and the installation fails. Workaround: Installation should be done using dummy database and node should be configured in the cluster post installation.
-	Database gets deleted after session node is uninstalled. This happens because by default database is removed after uninstalling node. Workaround: Uncheck Post installation database removal permission.
10992	When LDAP server is configured over SSL, it takes time to authorize/authenticate as Controller tries to resolve additional hosts. Workaround: Add appropriate host entry to reduce host resolution interval.
10575	Sometimes power off operation does not work with Nutanix dedicated session provider.
10327	Nutanix may keep old IP cache for some time and thus may result giving two IPs to HyWorks Controller causing issues.
Workaround: Configure controller to use appropriate IP filtering.
9569	HyWorks may not fail to authorize from configuration using AD for authentication and built-in for authorization but using UPN as logon attribute.
9519	HyWorks sends logs to Accops Reporting Server or Syslog only once. Due to this, if it fails to send logs, these logs are lost and reports does not show data points of that duration.
9493	HyWorks database restore fails if the parameters - Username, password, SQL server version, location; configured in the new SQL server and the one which is to be restored are same.
8555	HyWorks may not work correctly with proxy authentication server e.g. Accops directory server.
8439	Shadow sessions are created using the connection profile of the actual user session. Due to this, it might happen that Shadow session may not have features it actually requires. E.g. In user session, connection bar is disabled but in shadow session it will be needed.
-	Base DN and User DN is mandatory for configuring directory searcher option as LDAP searcher from advance config.
-	As Controller requires FQDN to communicate with AD over SSL, if Controller needs to point to a specific AD instance, its host entries must be created otherwise Controller will continue to use first resolved AD. With multiple session manager nodes, this is required for all the nodes.
-	DVM Power Policies in DVM Pool may conflict with Auto-login (Auto-login will keep the machine powered-on whereas power policy may try to power-off the DVMs). Administrators are required to keep power policies as default or disabled in DVM pools if intending to have auto login on registered devices.
7478	Power off, Reset or suspend events are not known to DVM agent and thus controller will not be notified immediately. Power status will be updated as per timeouts in HyWorks Controller.
7466	DVM Push will not work with SQL installed in Windows authentication mode only.
7082	Virtual IP for HA script does not support Ethernet name with space.
6380	Sometimes error log 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object' are generated, while restarting session host server.
6330	Logs are not generated, when desktop is not assigned to users if they are in maintenance mode on desktop pool.
6114	HyWorks Controller requires restart to refresh time zone details.
6101	Unable to delete organization though all visible objects in organizations are deleted.
Workaround: Before deleting organization, remove all the table references mentioned in logs.
5729	In some cases, HyWorks Controller installer is unable to detect correct OS type & previous installation of controller.
5698	Sometimes, select checkpoint in desktop pool wizard does not work in single click and may require reselection.
5681	With large deployments Hyper-V connector may stop responding and communication issues may occur due to timeouts or SSL errors.
5375	No desktop VM's are seen in Desktop VM tab of management console with zoomed in browser settings.
5279	Unable to authorize using built-in group Domain Users, when controller is not in same domain as configured AD (Both as authentication and authorization server).
5278	In Desktop pools - OU with special character is shown with garbage characters and after saving changes to "on" string
5273	HyWorks Controller does not support provisioning using templates with vCenter Server dedicated session provider.
5171	Pervious entitlements with authorization AD can login into client when authorization is changed to built-in when removal of entitlements.
5105	Some threads continue to connect to dedicated session provider though it’s made inactive.
5083	Updated AD group membership change is not getting fetched and thus failing to assign the desktops/apps runtime.
Workaround: Use advanced settings to use alternate methods of fetching groups.
5026	Desktop pools and reservations become accessible once associated client groups are deleted.
4840	Gold master concurrent access is not restricted, and hence multiple users can access desktops which supports multi-user sessions e.g. Linux desktops.
Controller Management Console Known Issues
#	Subject
26323	A misleading error "There is no authentication server configured" is shown while searching for a user with dot and auth-domain configuration is using built-in users.
26295	Login with HySecure link becomes visible though not enabled while trying to login with invalid credentials into management Console.
25963	Option to enable DVM Reset is disabled, while adding new persistent desktop pool with dynamic provisioning.
The issue is affecting all connectors: Nutanix, vCenter, SCVMM etc.
25922	Incorrect Desktop ready count is showing on pools page when new SHD is added using copy operation.
25232	On enabling Unassign on VDI log off, warning is displayed that hybrid mode is not enabled even when the hybrid mode enabled.
24872	It is possible to add duplicate AWS connector using the same information.
24869	A non-friendly error message is displayed if AWS connector is added with invalid credentials.
24866	A misleading error "One or more error occurred" is shown when administrator tries to add Oracle as connector in HyWorks with any of the incorrect details.
24804	Management Console fails to open, where its installed on Windows 2012R2 or lower with internal error 500.19.
Workaround: Delete the following flag from web.config:


22523	HyLite does not use the portal settings of HyWorks - Organization and thus all the customization have to be run via HySecure management console or HyLite configurations.
21121	HyWorks management console UI gets distorted while searching the groups or OUs with special characters e.g. pipe "|".
20961	Saving a session team after assigning more than 2.5K applications, management console becomes inaccessible.
20959	Server page in Management console displays list of configured servers without IP address, if the ethernet card, holding the primary IP address used to configured server on HyWorks is deleted from the provider.
20051	Incorrect VIP is shown in dialog box while removing the Permanent VIP assignment for user from User details page.
18827	To play session recording using HyWorks management console, either appropriate certificate must be configured on the SRMS server or exception should be added on user's machine.
To add exception: Get the complete recording URL by inspecting recording icon, open it in browser, when warning is displayed, accept it to proceed. Now the media or recordings can be played.
18524	Files deleted from SRMS server by administrator, will not be removed from Management console list and will fail to play.
18502	Deleting a recording profile assigned to connection profile fails but displays a success message and thus causes a confusion and also functional issues.
14424	It is not possible to exit the Desktop pool wizard if the Administrator has specified VM name prefix with unsupported chars and later corrected it
14405	Fetching Gold Master at the time of recompose results in exception if Gold Master name includes special characters.
14386	Error "Value cannot be null. Parameter name: source." is shown when user not having edit permission on capacity plan, tries to edit any existing plan.
14384	Change mode reflects with quite delayed response on UI and requires manual refresh.
14371	DVM Reset option is getting enabled and editable on selecting recompose for a non-persistent pool though no function impact even when unchecked.
14368	on Re-editing the Dedicated Desktop pool, section shown below Assign Desktop "on connect" is not getting displayed.
14365	On enabling Unassign User on VDI Logoff during Desktop pool creation, it is showing warning that Hybrid mode is not enabled even when the Hybrid mode is enabled.
14324	Adaptive load balancing type option should not visible for Linux session team, as monitoring service is not implemented in Linux SHD

Known Limitations and Issues in SHD and App Delivery
Last Updated Date: 22-Sep-2022
Release: HyWorks v3.4
Note

The Known issues list is updated with every release. This is the current list of known issues.

Windows Based Shared Hosted Desktops and Virtual App Delivery Known Issues
#	Subject
26461	Session host IP virtualization feature does not work in cloud deployments (Azure/AWS/Oracle).
25474	Shadow sessions are considered as direct RDP sessions and may get removed by the agent.
Workaround: Disable direct RDP block feature temporarily.
25118	Session host installation may not show any errors if the user running the setup does not have appropriate rights to add or update registries. This may result into functional failure at a later stage during the setup.
Recommendation: Session host installation logs should be verified post installation.
24995	Some exceptions are logged in session host logs, when a session host with multiple running sessions (with VIP enabled) is restarted.
Exception: The underlying provider may fail on Open.
24888	An error is logged in session host logs only after a shared hosted desktop pool is provisioned.
Error: region LastServiceForcedExit failed. Error: The media is write protected.
23964	Successful VIP removal log is not getting logged on controller, when session is logged out from within the session (SHD).
23408	Users fail to read the notification as Tray agent is getting opened in background in case of remote app session recording.
23297	Controller does not support upgrade of session host servers that have sessions running. Due to which such servers have to be manually accessed and upgraded.
22590	Windows server 2022 by default does not support multiple sessions of a single user. This can adversely affect virtual app delivery in shell mode.
Solution: Configure following group policy on server 2022:
- Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Connections.
- Set Restrict Remote Desktop Services user to a single Remote Desktop Services session to Disabled.
22519	Recording does not stop for the applications that are configured for it even after closing the application or even the application is not in use.
Same behaviour is observed for the configured network address.
22170	On removing the remote app sessions from controller, provider session is going into disconnected state.
Workaround: Configure the group policy to logout the remote app sessions immediately:
gpedit.msc > Computer configuration > Administrative template > Windows components > Remote desktop services > Remote desktop session host > Session Time limits > Set time limit for logoff of Remote app session.
21254	Logs are not created on HyWorks controller when local users are not created by session host server.
20938	Session recording may not start if recording is configured to be started on specific process launch and the process is initiated within 10 seconds of session start.
20725
11145	Mozilla firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer does not work correctly when initiated in a different user's context i.e. opened as a different user. This should be avoided.
19910	In a very rare case, monitoring service database is having some garbage values and because of that the service is not responding.
The database should be replaced with empty database and monitoring service should be restarted to solve the issue.
18860	Session recording not working when SMB2 based network is accessed.
16949	Powershell upgrade to v3.1 is must for Windows 2008R2-SP1 for trust relationship repair.
16941	Messages shown to user via virtual channels are outside of remote session and thus user may find it difficult to associate it with sessions, especially when running multiple virtual apps in shell mode.
16929	Capacity plan will continue to affect managed session team even when:
1. Plan is inactive 2. Session team in removed from capacity plan. 3. Schedule has expired. 4. Capacity plan is changed from enforce to disabled.
-	Chrome browser does not get launched in multiple remote sessions of a single user on Windows session host server.
Workaround: As many deployment need to access chrome as virtual app in shell mode, which will require multiple sessions of a single users from single session host server, specifying following command line will enable accessing chrome in shell mode multiple times:
Additional Command-line: --user-data-dir=%localappdata%\Google\Chrome\%sessionname%
14208	After upgrade or fresh installation of session host server, on first logon to server, couple of powershell windows will be shown for sometime.
13922	RDS role is bot available on Windows 2019 essentials and thus can not be used for virtual application or shared hosted desktop delivery.
Power Management Known Issues
#	Subject
-	Session host server power management is applied only to the deployed managed session host server teams and will not work for existing manually created teams.
Azure configuration is required to be done manually with privileged user account.
24889	While scaling down, maximum provisioned capacity is considered instead of minimum running capacity and thus can end-up in running more servers than planned.
24868	Error observed on HyWorks controller logs, when it tries to use cordoned servers for capacity plan scale up.
Error: Team ID or desktop provider IDs can not be null.
22037	Capacity planning is checking the plan objective closest to 12.00 am/0.00 in the current plan only, even if multiple plans are applied to the single session team and thus it may fail to implement objectives from other plans.
21875	Action processor service crashes when AccopsMQ is not reachable.
21735	On-demand scaling using capacity planning is not supported for virtual application sessions and works only for shared hosted desktop sessions.
21652	In some rare cases, action processor has cordoned more servers than expected.
Running sessions will not be affected but new users may have to wait for servers to be un-cordoned.
19776	The schedule background worker CPU usage can go high while saving a session team.
17689	If a managed (deployed) session team already exists and controller has been upgraded to v3.4, to generate schedule Ids the session team must be updated at least once.
16904	Some known limitations of automatic power management in HyWorks:
1. Backend call for plan implementation will occur at minimum 10 minute interval at 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.
2. Action processor is having two calls i.e. 1.Plan implementation 2.Dynamic scale, hence scale may happen in next cycle if call to scale occurs first
3. Virtual channel based notifications to end-users will work with Windows end-points only and will require virtual channels to be enabled in session using connection profiles.
4. Notification settings need to configure through appsettings.json file and service restart is also required.
5. Admin is not having control on dynamically managed teams, which essentially means even if some servers are powered-on or off may get reverted to original state as per capacity plans.
6. Actual shutdown of cordoned server may not happen on notified time and will happen on next dynamic scale trigger.
7. CPU/ RAM thresholds (if applied) can conflict with capacity plan as it only considers max sessions allowed per server.
8. Overlapping of two objectives will result in implementation of current objective and thus the previous plan objective in-progress may get affected.
13794	[Power management] Log should log on controller when power off/on operation is not required, currently no logs are logged on the controller.
13793	[power management] When SHD cloning failed, power management for session team should work according to successful cloned VMs count. It continues to use the desktop count as specified in desktop pool. Workaround: Update the desktop pool with new count or clone again to match the count.
13792	[power management] Logic App logs use session team ID and provider ID and thus admin needs to identify affected team using IDs.
13789	[power management] For every managed session team we need Azure access for creating Logic app.
13777	[Power management] When team size is getting reduced, power management should work accordingly.

#	Subject
24985
19564	The HyWorks Desktop Agent logs an "An invalid argument was supplied" error after the IP address of a VM is changed.
24930	The VM scale booster does not create the required firewall rule for port 5672, which is the port used by desktop agents to communicate. The rule has to be created manually if the Windows firewall is enabled on the VM scale booster server.
24000	The latest VM scale booster v3.4.0.80 is incompatible with older versions of HyWorks controllers (v3.3-R3(13832) or lower).
23975	During installation, no appropriate logs are generated by the VM scale booster if it is unable to configure AccopsMQ.
23963	If the Desktop Agent service is restarted during a running session that has recording enabled, the recorded file may be corrupted and fails to upload.
23824	Providing a user administrative privileges does not work on VMs with a Japanese OS.
23823	The HyWorks Desktop agent is unable to process a user with Japanese characters in their username and the session logs out.
23414	When the HyWorks Windows DVM Tools is uninstalled, the firewall rules created for built-in USB redirection driver are not removed and need to be removed manually.
22385	When DVM Tools are upgraded/repaired, the same version of the built-in USB redirection driver gets uninstalled and is re-installed, requiring a reboot.
22370	While installing the latest DVM tools, the option to install the USB redirection driver is checked by default, even if the latest version of the USB redirection driver is already installed.
22027	Upgrading the DVM tools may fail or the replacement of the new binaries of integrated components e.g. AUEM, recording modules may fail, when the upgrade is performed during a running session.
Recommendations: Upgrades should be done when there are no running sessions on the VM.
18844	The DVM Tools installer enters a non-responsive mode momentarily during un-installation.
18102	The VM Scale booster logs display the customization status as not initiated even when the customization option is not enabled.

#	Subject
27265	App Delivery: Linux session host server supports application delivery only in Shell mode.
Recommendations: Though connection profile -> Access mode is overridden, and shell mode is always used, but in any case if issue occurs and RemoteApp is set as access mode, it should be changed to Shell mode.
27264	App Delivery: Only a single session per user per server is supported.
Recommendation: Publish only single application or only shared hosted desktop pool from on Linux session host server. Both applications and shared hosted desktop or multiple applications should not be published.
26270	Warning is not displayed when Linux packages are being installed on unsupported versions. Check supported Linux flavors and versions for for HyWorks.
26088	HyShell is not working with latest assistive packages (v22022022) on Linux SHD v17.3 with VIP feature enabled.
25997
25995	Multiple packages are not installing on CentOS-v7.8.2003 and there are no error logsfor the same in the package installation logs. Current or latest assistive package (v06062022) can not be used for CentOS-v7.8.2003 delivery.
#25995: HyPrint is not working on CentOS with latest assistive packages (v06062022).
24768	The newly provided customization option "to make deployed VM member of AD group" does not work for Linux based VMs and is applicable only for Windows based VMs.
24742	Linux based VMs show old display name though updated on HyWorks Controller, as controller does not send updated display name of the user in subsequent calls.
24718	Session disconnection logs sent to syslog or ARS do not have PIDs and so it is not possible to associate it with the specific session.
24572	Linux based DVM tools does not support automatic repair or replace of corrupted local database. Administrator has to replace the database to resolve the issue.
23944	HyShell is not supported on any vanilla Xubuntu OSes i.e. v16/18/20.
23335	Connection to the RHEL based desktop fails when dollar sign is the last character of the username.

21744	IP virtualization feature is not supported with xUbuntu 16.04 or Accops SHD v1.7.3 and may cause system failures.
21729	After installing assistive packages on BOSS VM, built-in USB redirection service remains in disabled state by default.
Additional steps to be performed in BOSS for enabling services:
- Run script in assistive package "boss_os_run_after_reboot.sh"
21608	Power options are not visible for admin user in Linux SHD who is not part of "tsusers" group.
Workaround: Use commands to perform power operations.
21521	In Hyprep, at the time of joining the domain if just the Alternate DNS is configured or when both DNS are kept empty, Agent log displays AD DNS bad packet error and it is not possible to join the domain.
21420	On Xubuntu 18.4.1, Lock screen option is not working inside desktop session.
21399	IP address of BOSS VM is not getting reported on Hyper-V and thus delivery of BOSS OS based Linux desktops is not be possible from Hyper-V or SCVMM.
20476	On removing the app session from the Controller, session does not get terminated and Object ref is printed in desktop agent logs. The issue is observed intermittently on Xubuntu 16.
20057
20033	App/desktop session status is not getting updated on Controller and session host, when session gets disconnected because of network disconnection of SHD; even after SHD's network gets restored
20012	If the application session exists on controller even after the user has logged out of the application session and agent is down, user has to re-login to HyWorks.
19876	Instead of logging off, sessions are disconnected when 'Force user logoff' is configured in session team of non-persistent session host servers.
19583	HyPrep in Linux by default removes the network and recreates it and gets IP from DHCP, which means even if a deployment uses static IP of Gold master, it may get preserved on the cloned VMs post provisioning and customization in Accops.
18804	Domain joining GUI script is not working for Xubuntu 20.4.3 Non-HWE kernel (VM created from uploaded VHD).
17091	Additional limitations of Power management for Managed Linux SHD pool:
1. No notification is displayed to the user, when servers are cordoned or shutdown.
2. User will not be able to save the work before shutdown and results in data loss.
14576	Lag is observed while streaming video on Linux VDI compared to Windows Remote Desktops.
14567	When Proxy is enabled while installing DVM Tools assistive package, few packages are not getting installed.
Workaround: Provide direct internet access on VM where package needs to be installed.
14508	Intermittently built-in USB redirection driver goes into unreachable state resulting in USB redirection failure on Linux Virtual desktops when user logs in and logs out multiple times from VDI.
Workaround: Reboot Linux Virtual Desktop
14417	Intermittently error is logged in Desktop agent log of Linux SHD, while calling API..' log logged in.
14406	Centos 7.5 Linux VDI upgrade failed from version 04102018 to latest 20201110 version(offline package). CentOS 7.8.2003 is supported, thus upgrade of OS is expected.
14402	Controller settings in Database is not getting updated in case of upgrading latest DVM Tools (Via offline package)on Linux SHD v1.6
Workaround: Delete old database file and restart edcdvm service
14372	[LDAP] : Colon sign is not working with LDAP user.
14367	[LDAP] * Asterisk character is not supported in username (mid and last position).

Hyper-V Connector (Hyper-V/ SCVMM) Known Issues
#	Subject
23613	Controller is unable to process, Hyper-V VMs having special character sequence "<?" or "[]" in the name. An example of process failure can be unable to get IP address.
15298
15330	Hyper-V or SCVMM (Hyper-V connector) may intermittently go into unreachable state, without providing relevant logs on HyWorks Controller. Sometimes timeouts are observed.
15249	While deleting a provisioned desktop pool from an inactive Hyper-V connector, the actual VMs from Hyper-V or SCVMM are not deleted and also the administrator is not warned.
14574	Operational failures may occur if parallel operations (Delete VMs and Provisioning) is initiated on Hyper-V 2012R2 or 2016.
Recommendations: While working with Hyper-V, careful provisioning and operations should be done.
14501	Hyper-V 2012 - Cloning will fail with object reference error if source VM name is having following special characters: ` ~ ! $ % ^ & ( ) [ ] { } \
14422	[Hyper-V Connector - SCVMM] Replica is not deleted during recompose when clone type changed from Linked Clone to Full Clone
Workaround: Cleanup of replica can be done manually.A separate controller patch can be availed. Kindly contact Accops Support team for the same.
14420	Linked clone or clone with Snapshot fails with SCVMM is gold image name is having more than 20 characters
Workaround: Gold VM or Source VM name should be less than 18 characters.A separate controller patch can be availed. Kindly contact Accops Support team for the same.
14419	[Hyper-V/ SCVMM] Cloning failures due to special chars in Gold Image (Source VM) name or Snapshot name (Feature: Clone from Snapshot)
Recommendations: Following special characters should not be used in Hyper-V or SCVMM source VM name or snapshot name.
[For SCVMM] Chararacters not supported in - VM name: space,,?,:,<,>,/,|,\,",',{,} Characterss not supported in Snapshot name: `,&,\,",'
[For Hyper-V] Chars not supported in VM name: ,?,:,<,>,/,|,\,",',{,},[,]
14383	Sometimes cloning fails on Hyper-V with error: Creating the disk at location failed. .

Known Limitations and Issues of HyLabs
Last Updated Date: 22-Sep-2022
Release: HyWorks v3.4
Note

The Known issues list is updated with every release. This is the current list of known issues.

#	Subject
27266	HyLabs(HyLite) is not supported with authentication domain having following configurations: authentication server - built-in, authorization server - built-in and user credentials for remote server - User provided credentials.
AD/LDAP based authentication configurations should be used.
14403	Reservation Redeployment is getting stuck when snapshot setting is changed.
13393	Daily reservation is shown to run after one month after editing (4 schedules are there with daily recurrence even past dates). Workaround: Update the schedules again.
12973	Incorrect log is displayed for fix course self-study operation of powered off reserved VMs.
12970	Self-study - Events that are not required to be logged are also logged.
12884	No conflict occurs if Self-study is created simultaneously by the participant and admin.
10916	With ‘Reuse VMs..” disabled in reservation, course self-studies scheduled near to course reservation end-time may fail. Recommendation: Create self-studies after some time of course reservation end so that course reservation can be ended.
10891	CSV import fails for Unicode file format. Workaround: Use other supported formats like UTF-8, Shift-JIS etc.
10881	Machine keys in IIS configuration for HyWorks web application resets on upgrade and login from HyLite results in error page 'Server Error in '/' Application.' => Error occurred during a cryptographic operation. Workaround: HyWorks Management Console web application Machine keys should be backed-up before upgrade and should be restored after the upgrade.
10879	Schedule code accepts special character ` and Code validation error occurs if administrator continues to schedule reservation with provided code. Recommendation: The mentioned special character should not be used.
10877	No warning or information of associated course self-study is shown while redeploying course reservation.
10874	Course reservation with higher limits can be created if gold master is modified to reduce the previous allowed set limit.
Recommendation: Delete and recreate the Gold Master instead of modifying the existing one.
10868	Audit announcement is shown to the users, even when inactive Workaround: Delete audit announcement if not needed.
10806	Running reservation time can change after editing and re importing CSV. Recommendation: Do not update running reservations using CSV.
10794	Unable to import users when realm name is mentioned in CSV.
10771	Users not part of any course will not be able to access self-study reservations made by reservation admin for them. Workaround: Create a dummy course for such users.
10757	Allow Connect option works only when preparation time is higher than the allow connect time. Reservations must be in running state for allow connect function to work.
10716	Pool creation types gets reset to 0 for RMS created desktop pools -> Leaves existing desktop pool, replica, resource pool as unmanaged. Recommendation: RMS desktop pools should not be altered from HyWorks Management Console.
10676	Course Self-Study reservation option should not be present in management for assistant user.
Recommendation: This is a duplicate option in HyLabs screen for assistant user. If needed, add reservation option itself can be disabled for assistant user from HyWorks Management Console.
10643	If RMS admin and the Participant creates Self-study for the conflicting time, Participant is unable to create more reservations.
Recommendation: Delete one of the self-study reservations for user.
10640	If RMS admin creates one self-study for participant, participant's count for "Max Self-Studies Allowed" remains intact. Recommendation: Self-study should be initiated by end-users only and thus administrators should not create self-study reservations for them.
10603	On deleting Reservation Pool manually, its resource pool does not get deleted from vCenter.
Recommendation: RMS desktop pools should not be altered from HyWorks Management Console.
10027	"Number of connections exceeded" error is displayed in the Schedule tab instead of Self-Study Reservation.
10026	CSV Import: Reservation is getting added, even when self-study enabled has duration set as 0.
Recommendation: Self-study duration should not be kept as 0 while being imported from CSV.
9044	MMC and RMS service config details should be restored post upgrade.
Recommendation: Backup should be taken before upgrade for smooth and faster restoration of configurations.
8854	Incorrect Japanese translation in Deployment options dialog. Recommendation: Use Chrome or Firefox for administration.
8709	Course self-study is getting failed when "Assign network ready desktops" is enabled on Gold master.
Recommendation: Keep the flag as disabled in provisioning profiles.
8648	Reservation should be highlighted using some mechanism if they have some recommended deployment options pending.
8384	Admin, incharge can create self-study with same time as existing user self-study.
8192	Calendar should show all reservation assigned to Participant/ Incharge / assistant.

Accops HyWorks Deployment Options
Accops HyWorks v3.3 can deliver applications, shared hosted desktops or dedicated desktops in:

LAN - Users can directly reach control layer and data layer

WAN - recommended when users have to access resources over the internet

Deployment in LAN Environment
Deployment of HyWorks in LAN, MPLS WAN or P2P WAN requires:

HyWorks Controller installed and available in the LAN

Firewall or third-party software should not be blocking HyWorks Controller.

HyDesk or HyWorks Clients are installed and running in the same network and should be able to:

Detect and connect HyWorks Controller using UDP discovery method

Connect to a HyWorks Controller through configured IP address

Dedicated Desktops:

HyWorks Controller and Session Providers like VMware vCenter Server or Microsoft SCVMM Server and authentication servers like Microsoft Active Directory or LDAP must be in the same network and reachable.

DVMs running on Session Providers must be reachable to HyDesk/HyWorks Client devices.

Shared Hosted or Desktops:

HyWorks Session Host server must be installed on Microsoft RDS server and is configured in HyWorks.

HyWorks Session Host server must be directly accessible from HyWorks/HyDesk client.

Below given deployment image shows the placement of Accops HyWorks. The device should be able to talk to the Accops HyWorks Controller on port 38866 and to the virtual machine on TCP port 3389.

confidence

Deployment in WAN Environment
To access applications, shared hosted desktops or dedicated desktops it is ncessary to connect with Accops HyWorks Controller, Session host and DVMs. This is not possible when users access resources over the internet (WAN) or are not part of your . To provide access in such scenarios HyWorks needs to be integrated with Accops HySecure. You can also use your own VPN but certain security features and single sign-on offered by HySecure will not be available.

Once HyWorks and HySecure are integrated:

HySecure acts as an gateway and users can connect to the VM through the HySecure gateway

Devices over the internet can directly access HySecure Gateway using Public IP address

HySecure Gateway is configured to have applications as

HyWorks Controller (Port:38866). HyWorks Controller has pre-set configuration i.e. Session host Servers, Authentication servers, Session Teams, Applications, Desktop Pools, assignments etc.

HyWorks Application Servers (3389) for applications and shared desktop access

Note:

Minimum recommended configuration for HyWorks Controller is 4GB RAM/ 4 vCPUs and then can be configured as per requirement.
Parallel user onboarding rate also affects overall performance of the system and thus the attribute of login per second must be considered during planning phase. For deployments, having higher login per second e.g., 6 user per second or greater, should consider having premium SSDs and higher resource configurations for database servers.
It is recommended to configure VM Scale Booster, when Managed SHDs are more than 50 or powered ON DVMs are more than 500.

Change the Location (the current VM will be cloned at the source VM location)

The latest Gold Master changes require manual intervention. Recompose and cloning uses Snapshot for ExpireSnapshotAfterLastUseInMin.

The old Snapshot is deleted when the time interval between current the Time and LastUsedTimeForCloning exceeds Time to Live (ExpireSnapshotAfterLastUseInMin). The old Snapshot deletion occurs with every new clone job.

Oracle Disk Snapshot Time To Live
In Oracle, a snapshot is used to clone the OS Disk and Data Disk. These Disks are deleted according to their time to live after cloning is complete. This deletion process depends on three Tags - two on the Gold Master Disk and one on Snapshot.
Gold Master Tags : 1. ExpireSnapshotAfterLastUseInMin (In min) (Default 48 hours): Reduce this time interval to reflect the latest Gold master changes applicable on Recompose and fresh cloning. 2. CreateNewSnapshot (Default False): This tag will force create a new snapshot with every cloning. Recommended to keep this tag set to "False".

SnapShot Tags : 1. LastUsedTimeForCloning (In Epoc): This is updated for the Snapshot every time a clone is created from this snapshot.

The Gold Master tag and snapshot tag are created at the first call of cloning the VM with the Default value. The Admin can change ExpireSnapshotAfterLastUseInMin and CreateNewSnapshot based on their requirements.

Configurations and Environment Preparation
Authentication Configuration of Linux SHD/DVM Servers
Once all the required packages are installed, the next step is to configure Linux VDI for authentication. Three types of authentications are supported: Microsoft Active Directory, LDAP and Workgroup.

Join AD Domain
Active directory domain can be joined using:

Accops Custom Script (Recommended Process)
Accops GUI Script
Using DomainJoin - CLI (Command Lines)
Important

The assistive packages must be installed for active directory environment. If not the environment switch scripts should be used to set the machine for AD environment.
Accops Custom Script (Recommended Process)
Follow the below given steps to join the Linux SHD/DVM to AD:

Open Terminal on Ubuntu VM and execute the following command to join the machine to the specified AD.

sudo /usr/bin/edcdvm/scripts/active_directory_join.py <JSON-INPUT>

JSON-INPUT:


    "{

            "\"JoinDomainType"\":1,

            "\"ComputerName"\":"\"<ComputerName>"\",

            "\"DomainName"\":"\"<DomainName>"\",

            "\"DomainUserNme"\":"\"<DomainUserName>"\",

            "\"DomainUserPassword"\":"\"<DomainUserPassword>"\",

            "\"PreferredDns"\":"\"<PreferredDNS>"\",

            "\"AlternateDns"\":"\"<AlternateDNS>"\"

    }"
In the above command, replace the following parameters with the required values:

<ComputerName>: Name to be assigned to the machine.

<DomainName>: Domain name of your organization. Machine will be joined to this domain.

<DomainUserName>: User having rights to add/update objects in Active directory for joining the machine to domain.

<DomainUserPassword>: Password of the domain user

<PreferredDNS>: IP address of preferred DNS server

<AlternateDNS>: IP address of alternate DNS server

If the machine has joined domain successfully, success message will be displayed in command output. Alternatively use the below given command to verify:


> sudo domainjoin-cli query
The output of this command will display the new machine name and domain information.

Joining Machine to Domain using GUI Script
Open Terminal and go to directory


>   cd /usr/bin/edcdvm/scripts
Run command


>   sudo ./active_directory_join_GUI.py
Provide root password if prompted

Domain join window will be displayed



Provide the details and click on OK button to proceed.

Computer Name: New hostname for the machine e.g., itubuntu-001

Preferred DNS: Primary DNS server address

Alternate DNS: Secondary DNS server address

Domain Admin Username: Username of AD user having appropriate rights on AD to join machine to domain

Domain Admin Password: Password of AD user provided above

Domain Name: Domain name to which this machine to be joined e.g., example.local

Machine will be joined to the domain. Reboot the machine once it is configured correctly to domain.

Join AD using DomainJoin using Command line
Prerequisites:

Offline package and DVM Tools are installed

Appropriate DNS entries are added into VM network configuration settings

Change Hostname: It is important to have a unique hostname of Linux SHD/DVM (specially if you're trying to join VM to AD), as having the same hostname in network may drop the connection. To change hostname of Linux SHD, follow the below steps:

Open Terminal on Ubuntu VM and execute the following command:

sudo domainjoin-cli setname \<new hostname>

Reboot the machine

Join Domain:

Make sure date/time is correctly synced with active directory machine

Open Terminal on Ubuntu VM and execute the following command:

sudo domainjoin-cli join 'domain_name' 'domain_user' 'domain_password'

If the machine has joined domain successfully, success message will be displayed.

Reboot the machine

Configure to Authenticate with LDAP
Important

The assistive packages must be installed for LDAP environment. If not the environment switch scripts should be used to set the machine for LDAP environment.
Follow the steps given below to join the Linux SHD/VM to LDAP:

Open Terminal and go to the directory where offline package is extracted

cd /home/\<Username>)

Find LDAP configuration template file at \<assistive package root>/ templates/ldap_templates

cd \<assistive package path>/templates/ldap_templates

Make the following changes in ldap.conf and sssd.conf,:

Ldap.conf changes:

Change BASE with the Base DN details of your organization

Change URI with address of LDAP server in format ldaps://\<LDAP Server IP>



sssd.conf changes:

ldap_uri in format ldaps://\<LDAP server IP address>

ldap_search_base: base DN of LDAP server; e.g. dc=example,dc=mylabs,dc=com

ldap_user_search_base = OU or container in which the specific user should be searched e.g. ou=IT,ou=Pune,ou=india,dc=example,dc=mylabs,dc=com

ldap_group_search_base = OU or container in which the specific group should be searched e.g. ou=IT,ou=Pune,ou=india,dc=example,dc=mylabs,dc=com



Save the config files

Run the script from same folder

./script+readme.sh

After the script execution is completed successfully, reboot the machine. The machine is not ready for user authentication and access with configured LDAP server.

Note

In Centos7-Everything-1708/1804 to run script+readme.sh it requires "openldap-clients" package which needs to be installed manually otherwise it will throw an error as "ldapsearch command not found".

Deployment in Workgroup Environment
Make sure to install dependency packages for workgroup or use switch scripts later for configuring machine for specific environments.

Switch the Deployment Mode of Machine
Use the script mentioned below to change the deployment from AD to LDAP:

Go to location where DVM Tools Assistive Online Package is extracted
Now go to extracted folder and locate script and run following command
sudo ./switch_ldap_AD_workgroup.sh [Option], where [Option] is target environment.

Examples:

To remove previous configurations and make it ready for LDAP environment


>   sudo  ./switch_ldap_AD_workgroup.sh LDAP =>
To remove previous configurations and make it ready for AD environment


>   sudo  ./switch_ldap_AD_workgroup.sh AD
To remove previous configurations and make it ready for Workgroup environment


>   sudo  ./switch_ldap_AD_workgroup.sh WG
This will remove all the previous configuration and admin need to add new configuration as per the requirement.

RHEL Subscription Configurations
Accops HyWorks does not update the subscription details of RHEL machine being prepared by installing packages or using dynamic provisioning and thus all such VMs prepared have to update the subscription details.

Follow the steps given below to update subscription details:

Open terminal and use below commands:

>   sudo subscription-manager clean
>   sudo subscription-manager register --username <Username> --password <password>
>   sudo subscription-manager attach --auto
>   sudo yum update



Advance Configurations for Linux Session Host Servers
Session Host IP Virtualization
Latest Linux Session host servers support IP virtualization, where each remote session can be provided a unique IP. Having a unique IP in session, enables user identification on the Internet and Internet isolation if required.

If it is needed to enable session host IP virtualization, refer document Session Host IP Virtualization for all relevant configurations on Linux session servers.

The configurations done on Linux gold master will be reflected on all cloned VMs and hence, the Linux server team deployed with pool will be having all session host servers with identical session host IP virtualization configurations.

Direct RDP /Console Block
In some deployments, direct access (console/RDP) needs to be blocked for the users and only connection through HyWorks are to be supported. Direct access can be blocked by configuring settings as given below in the vmInfo.json file of Linux server:

File Path: /etc/edcdvm/linuxDVM/vminfo.json

Available Configurations:

DirectRdpBlock: Set this flag to True to block direct remote connections. Default value is false.

DirectRdpAdminBlock: Set this flag to True for blocking direct remote connections by admin users. Default value is false.

DirectConsoleBlock: Enable the setting for blocking the direct connection via console. By default it is disabled.

DirectConsoleAdminBlock: Enable the setting for Direct console block for admin users. By default it is disabled.

DirectRdpBlockTimeoutSec: Update the time for Direct RDP/console block session. (Default:10sec).

Note

The direct RDP block timeout configuration must be set as per the profile loading and overall connection time. If timeout is kept as very less, DVM agent may throw out valid sessions as well.
Pre and Post HyPrep Script Execution Support
Latest version of DVM Tools for Linux supports execution of pre or post HyPrep scripts. These scripts are added to customize files accordingly e.g., hosts or hostanme after hyprep.

Script Path: /etc/edcdvm/linuxDvm/scripts/

Script Names: HyprepPreScript.sh, HyprepPostScript.sh

Pre and Post AppLauncher Script Execution Support
Latest version of DVM Tools for Linux supports pre and post Applauncher script execution.

Script Path: /etc/edcdvm/linuxDVM/scripts

Script Names: AppLauncherPostScript.sh, AppLauncherPreScript.sh

Note

Update the given script with custom tasks if required.
Set isWaitTillCompletion flag as True, if you want AppLauncher to wait for completion of this script execution.
Accepting calls from Authorized controller only
Latest Linux DVM agent can be configured accept calls from specified controller only. Call from any other controller can be rejected.

Follow the steps given below to configure the Authorized controller entry:

Connect to Linux SHD Server via SSH Client or Terminal
Go to the /etc/edcdvm/linuxDVM directory
Edit the appsettings.json file and set appropriate controller IP for flag AllowedControllerList
Restart the edcdvm service.
Now this server will accept call from provided HyWorks Controller address only.
HyShell Configurations for Linux SHD Servers
Note

HyShell is supported only the Linux SHD OS that is provided by Accops and does not work for vanilla images.
HyShell is desktop customization utility which can be used to change the configuration on the Shared Hosted Desktops:

Create Allowed applications shortcuts on Start Menu and Desktop.

Restrict user access for any other applications.

Due to application usage limitations, it is recommended to use HyShell enabled Linux Shared Hosted desktops, so that the users can be given a restricted access to full desktop with the allowed applications only.

The customizations include restricting native applications from adding access points for published apps assigned to the user in SHD as application menu and desktop icons.

Various set of configurations are possible and below table details these combinations and their impact in behavior.

Configured in Controller	Enabled in SHD	Impact
No	No	User gets desktop with no restrictions
Yes	No	User gets desktop with no restrictions
No	Yes	User gets restricted desktop with no application (neither assigned apps nor native apps)
Yes	Yes	User gets restricted desktop only with assigned applications (no native applications will be available.
Note

When desktop is restricted:

User gets access to only those applications that are assigned by HyWorks.

If HyWorks is configured to show desktop shortcuts in SHD, desktop displays icons for assigned applications only

If HyWorks is configured to pin applications on Start menu in SHD, Application menu will show only hosted applications along with the disconnect option

User is not allowed to personalize desktop

HyShell can also be configured to execute user scripts in both system and user context before and after HyShell execution.

How to enable HyShell in Linux Session Host Server
Follow the steps given below to enable HyShell in Linux SHD:

Connect to linux SHD server via SSH Client(if ssh enabled) or console session

Open HyShell configuration file

sudo vi /etc/edcdvm/linuxDVM/hyShell/hyshell.config

Set the value for IS_HYSHELL_ENABLED to 1.



Desktop restriction is not applicable to all the users in included in EXCLUDE_USERS_LIST

Restart DVM Agent Service by executing following command

sudo systemctl restart edcdvm

Linux SHD is now enabled with HyShell.

Note

HyShell configuration is a server level configuration and applicable for all the users accessing Linux SHD Desktops.

Once enabled, HyShell provides access to only those applications, that are assigned to the user and published from that server. In other words if a user is not having any applications assigned then the customized Linux SHD desktop will not show any application or shortcuts.

HyShell configuration may take 3 to 5 seconds to load.

Enable Published Applications for HyShell
Once HyShell is enabled in Linux Session Host Server, applications must also be configured to be shown in the user session.

Follow the steps given below to publish applications for Linux Shared hosted desktops:

Follow the steps mentioned in section Application Publishing in HyWorks

In Application Add/ Edit wizard > Additional Settings > Access Settings section

Uncheck option Publish the application on > Portal and client: This will stop showing application on the client screen.

Configure Create Desktop Shortcut

On User PC option - Uncheck (this will not create Desktop shortcuts on User PCs)

On Shared Hosted Desktop option - Check

Configure Pin Application to Start Menu

On User PC option - Uncheck (This will not pin Application on User PCs)

On Shared Hosted Desktop option - Check



Above configuration will create all the applications' shortcut on the desktop or Start menu for the user session.

Run Custom Shell Scripts in User Session
Follow the steps given below to run the custom shell script if required:

Connect to Linux SHD Server via SSH Client or Terminal

Go to HyShell directory to locate scripts you want to run by executing following command:

cd /etc/edcdvm/linuxDVM/HyShell/

Modify and save the following scripts as per the requirement:

HyShellLauncherPreScript.sh: This script executes before HyShell is launched.

HyShellLauncherPostScript.sh: This script executes after HyShell is launched successfully.

Scripts will execute from next logon to SHD from server.

Syslog configuration for forwarding Audit Logs to Syslog Server
Linux SHD integrated HyWorks DVM tools supports sending user session logs to Syslog server.

Desktop Agent Logs Format

On Logon, information of 'Display_Port' and 'PID' is not available and hence DASH (-) is displayed in syslog.
Syslog Configuration Process
Follow the below steps to configure logs forwarding to syslog server:

Take console or RDP session of Linux VDI Gold Master VM with user having sudo permission

Create a file with name EventTypedataPath.txt at /etc/edcdvm/linuxDVM by executing command

cd /etc/edcdvm/linuxDVM

Update file with following contents with sudo access:

{

"EventType":3,

"LogType":3,

"SyslogHost":"<Syslog server IP>",

"SyslogPort":"514",

}

Save the file and restart DVM Agent Service by executing following command

systemctl restart edcdvm

Verify configuration by connecting to the VM using HyWorks client and check syslog server if appropriate log entries are added.

Basic HyWorks Configuration
Basic HyWorks configuration is for organizations with a Single Organization structure, in which logical separation of resources is not required. It also includes configuration of the authentication mode.

Refer to the configuration steps mentioned in the Multi-Organization Deployment section in case a logical separation of resources is required.

HyWorks Deployment in a Single Organization
While this flowchart depicts the entire configuration, this section describes steps of the basic configuration only.



Step 1: Install the HyWorks Controller service and Management console
HyWorks Controller supports two types of deployments:

Standalone (HyWorks without High Availability)

The HyWorks Controller must be installed with the SQL Servers. Refer to the HyWork Controller Installation section for details.

Cluster

HyWorks Controllers must be installed with the SQL Server with some additional prerequisites. Refer to the HyWorks Controller Installation For Cluster section for details.

Use the Installation Wizard to install the HyWorks Controller and Management console. Refer to the HyWorks Installation section for the entire flow of installation.

Step 2 Add the Authentication server and the Authentication Domain configuration
Once the installation process is complete, the next step is to add the authentication server and configure the authentication domain to specify the authorization and authentication servers.

HyWorks supports the following authentication servers:

Microsoft Active Directory
Novell Directory/Open LDAP
Built-in (available by default)
Configure Authentication Server:

Go to Settings > Configure > Authentication and click Add

In the Authentication Server window, select the Server Type, for example Microsoft Active Directory, Novell Directory/Open LDAP and specify the following information:

Enter the display name for the authentication server. This is to uniquely identify the server.

Provide the server address, for example, 192.168.1.1 or Accops.com

Provide an appropriate Domain name which could be the NetBIOS Name for domain (this domain name information will be used for signing into the remote sessions).

The Port Number to be used to communicate with the authentication server (default is 389).

Enable SSL: Check this checkbox if the configured Active Directory supports secure communication (the default port for SSL communication is 636).

Provide the Base DN information (mandatory for LDAP type authentication server and for Active Directory configurations, when the Active Directory options value under System -> Advance Config is set as 6, which uses the LDAP search method to communicate with AD).

All the users, groups and OUs will be fetched if the Base DN information is not provided.

On providing the specific Base DN information, users, groups or OUs will be fetched accordingly.

The User DN (mandatory for LDAP type authentication server and for Active Directory configurations, when the Active directory options value under System > Advance Config is set as 6, which uses the LDAP search method to communicate with AD ). This is the user that will be used to communicate with the Active Directory server. The user should have privileges to fetch the user, group, OU information under the specified base DN.

Username: The username of the user from authentication to be used to communicate with the Active Directory server, the user should have privileges to fetch user, group, OU information. This field is available for Active Directory type authentication server configuration only.

A valid Password for the user configured in step# 7-8.

Select an appropriate Login Attribute: User Id, User Principal Name, Mail Id, Phone number. The selected attribute will be used to authenticate user the on logon.

User Id: Map the username entered by the user with the User Id field of HyWorks

User Principal Name: Map the username entered by the user with the User Principal Name field of HyWorks. HyWorks will form the User Principal Name using the following methods:

User logon using only the username without a domain name: HyWorks will generate the UPN using the domain name configured in the authentication server configuration. For example, the user logs-in using john.test => john.test@domain.com

User logon using the domain name\username: HyWorks will generate the UPN using the domain name and the username provided by the user. For example, the user logs-in using domain.com\john.test => john.test@domain.com

User logon using the full UPN in format username@domain-name: HyWorks will use the credentials as provided. For example, the user logs in using john.test@domain.com => john.test@domain.com

Mail Id: Map the username entered by the user with the Mail Id field of HyWorks

Phone Number: Map the username entered by the user with the Phone Number field of HyWorks

Note

Default login attribute for configuring the Active directory is SAMAccountName and for configuring the LDAP is CN. These attributes (SAMAccountName with AD and CN with LDAP server) are most commonly the user login attribute.
Log Attributes in Login: Optional, specify the AD attributes that will be logged in logs along with each user login event. This field can be used to create additional information in the log file to generate a customer report.

Skip Login Attribute Verification: By default is enabled but when unchecked, all four underlying attributes will be checked on the AD, whether they are present or not when configuring the AD. If checked and it is found that any attribute is missing in the AD, then an error will be reported during user login. For example, if the "Phone Number" attribute is specified as the "telephoneNumber" AD attribute and this attribute does not exist in the AD, an error will be reported during login.

Add secondary authentication server: By default is unchecked, select and provide details of the secondary authentication server for Active Directory failover conditions. The provided secondary authentication server must be in sync with the primary Active Directory server.

Click Test Connection.

If the connection is established successfully, click Add.

This completes the Authentication Server configuration. For detailed information, refer to the Authentication Server Configuration Section in Admin Guide.

Configure Authentication Domain:

Authentication domain defines the server to be used for authentication and the server to be used for authorization (entitlements).
Authentication and authorization servers can be the same or different, based on the requirement.
The Domain name to be used for connections, etc.
To configure the Authentication domain, follow the steps given below:

Go to Settings > Configure > Organizations

Select default or child organization and click Edit.

In the Edit Organization wizard, go to the Authentication Domain section and specify:

Authentication Server: This server will authenticate the user on logon.

Authorization Server: All assignments and entitlements will be done from this server.

The Domain Name will be fetched from:

Authentication Server
Authorization Server
Custom Domain
If you are using the Built-in Authorization server, provide the following information:

User creation on RDS: Choose Manual synchronization to synchronize manually or set as Automatically on logon or Do not create.

User credentials for RDS: Select Built-in directory credential if you want to connect to HyWorks using the built-in credentials. If you do not select this option, the connection will be made using the logged-in user credentials (user-provided credentials).

Populate users into the built-in directory : Define how users will be populated in the Built-in directory.

Create Users in the Built-in Directory - If you choose this option, the Administrator will have to add users manually or by importing them from CSV files.
Import Users from the Authentication Server - If you choose this option, you will be able to import users from other authentication servers into the Built-in directory.
Note

If the authentication and authorization servers are using different search attributes, it may result in logon failure or authorization issues.
Go to the Desktop Client Settings and click Save.

This completes the configuration of the Authentication domain.

The subsequent steps will depend on the kind of session delivery mechanism.

Pooled Sessions Limitations
Limitations for Linux Desktops/App Delivery
Linux SHD Server supports only single remote session of a user so it is recommended to publish only one application from each Linux SHD server

Multiple application sessions from a single server for a user are not supported

Shared hosted desktop session with any other application session from same server are not supported.

The very first user session of shared desktop/application from Linux client might take 15 seconds to 20 seconds to launch.

Single Instance per user is limited as single server single application is published.

Session management is controller driven and no VDI internal timeouts will work, which essentially means that if user is idle on Linux server, the agent can not track and process it accordingly.

Connection Profile for Linux App and SHD Delivery
For Linux application and SHD delivery to work properly, associated connection profile must have a few settings as follows:

Setting title	Value
Application Launch Mode	Shell Mode
Session Experience Option	Never Seamless


User Logon for Verification
Once all above configurations are done, the last step is to login from Client or User Workspace portal to verify whether all configurations are working correctly. Follow the steps specified below:

Download latest HyWorks Client from Accops Official Website Download Client.

Install HyWorks Client on Windows desktops and configure them as per the requirement

Client Mode: Desktop Client

Component Selection: Select appropriate USB Redirection Driver as per need

Launch HyWorks Client and connect to HyWorks Controller/ HySecure Server using IP address or Hostname

Prepare Microsoft SQL Server for HyWorks Deployment
Configure the SQL Server as follows to support the HyWorks Controller and clustering:

Enable remote connections on the SQL Server instance

Configure the SQL server to listen on the static port

Turn on the SQL Server Browser service

Assumption: The SQL Server is already installed (with Windows authentication or mixed mode) and ready for configurations.

Enable Remote connections on the SQL Server Instance
Follow the steps given below to configure the SQL Server to allow remote connections:

Open the SQL Management Studio and connect to the SQL Server that is to be configured as the database server for the HyWorks Controller

Right click server name in the left pane and select Properties



Select Connections

Under the Remote server connections section, select the Allow remote connections to This server



Configure the SQL server to communicate on the static port
The HyWorks Controller supports communication with the SQL server over static port. Using the dynamic port may result in database connectivity problems.

VERIFY WHETHER THE SQL SERVER IS USING A STATIC TCP PORT
Open the SQL Server Configuration Manager

Click the SQL Server Services



Note down the process ID of the SQL Server instance as displayed in the right pane, for example, 116 being displayed in the above image

Open the command prompt and execute the following command:

Code

netstat -ano | find /i \<PID of SQL Server>

e.g. netstat -ano | find /i "116"



The command will not show any output if the SQL Server is not using a static TCP port and should be configured to use one, as shown in the above screenshot.

ENABLE THE SQL SERVER TO COMMUNICATE ON A STATIC PORT
Go to the SQL Server Configuration Manager

Click SQL Server Network Configuration

Right click TCP/IP protocol and select Enable



Restart the SQL Server service and identify the process ID assigned to the SQL service.



To verify whether the SQL services are listening on a TCP port or not, execute the following command in the command prompt:

netstat -ano | find /i \<PID of SQL Server>



To configure a specific port

In the SQL Server Configuration Manager

Click SQL Server Network Configuration

Right click TCP/IP protocol

Select Properties

Go to IP Address > IPAll

Remove the value configured in the TCP Dynamic Ports section. Make sure not to configure 0 (zero).

Configure 1433 or any other port as per the requirement for TCP Port



Restart the SQL Server service. Identify the new process ID assigned to the SQL service and in the command prompt, execute the following command to verify whether the SQL Service is now listening on the configured TCP Port i.e. 1433.

netstat -ano | find /i "PID of SQL Server";



SQL Express should now be configured to listen on the standard port 1433. Check the SQL Server port reachability from the Controller Installer server.

Microsoft SQL Server 2012

Please refer section Preparing Microsoft SQL Server for HyWorks Deployment for detailed instructions on SQL Server configurations for HyWorks installation.


Installation Modes
HyWorks can be installed in two different modes:

Standalone mode
Cluster mode
For each mode, two types of installation is supported:

First time Installation

Maintenance

a. Add New Components

b. Repair

c. Upgrade

d. Uninstall



Controller
Follow the process provided in below sections to install HyWorks Controller version v3.3-R3 or later including latest v3.4.

Note

Running HyWorks setup from from UNC path is not supported and will result in setup failure. It is needed to copy HyWorks setups locally on target servers instead of running them from UNC path.
Running HyWorks setup may also fail during file extraction, if logged-in user is having roaming profile. In this case, login with local administrator user will be required.
Important Options in HyWorks Controller Installation Wizard
Components to Install During installation, the following components of HyWorks management layer can be installed:

HyWorks Controller Service: Select this option, if server is to be configured as HyWorks Controller node.
HyWorks Controller Management Console: Select this option, if server is to be used for hosting Management Console web application as well. Management Console should not be installed on servers functioning in broker role.
Accops HyWorks Reservation Management Service: Option will be enabled only when management console is installed on the same server. HyLabs or Reservation Management Services should only be installed, if deployment is intended to have HyLabs as well.
Deployment Modes HyWorks Controller can be installed in the following modes:

Two-node Active-Passive Cluster: HyWorks controller nodes can be installed on two identical Windows servers and can be joined to form a cluster with one HyWorks controller acting as master or primary node. This deployment mode can be used to serve up to 2500 concurrent user sessions. This mode should be used for deploying standalone HyWorks Controller, which can be used for some quick verification or evaluation.

Multi-node Active-Active Cluster: Multiple HyWorks Controller nodes are installed with appropriate roles (node type) to form a multi-node cluster. Two HyWorks nodes functions as management nodes to manage complete HyWorks infrastructure, where as one or more HyWorks nodes can be installed as broker nodes to handle client and session host server requests. Multi-node setup requires external load balancer to distribute traffic among broker (session) nodes. This deployment mode should be used for larger deployments, going to have more than 2500 concurrent user sessions.

Database High-availability Configuration Database high-availability can be achieved using following mechanisms:

SQL Server Managed Database High Availability: In this mechanism, HyWorks requires clustered SQL servers behind a single access point. Database availability will be managed by SQL Servers and HyWorks will simply access it on address provided.

HyWorks Managed Database High Availability: In this mechanism, HyWorks manages database high availability. HyWorks initiates syncing of databases every minute using Microsoft Sync Framework.

Roles (Node) Types HyWorks Controllers can have following roles:

Management Node: responsible for communication with session providers and managing HyWorks deployments. But will not participate in endpoint requests handling (Login, connections etc.) or session updates by session host servers.

Broker (Session) Node: responsible to perform all the brokering tasks i.e. taking endpoint requests and getting session updates. Broker nodes will not participate in management activities.

SQL Server Authentication Mechanism HyWorks Controller supports following authentication mechanism:

SQL Server Authentication: Uses username and password to connect to SQL Server for database creation and management by HyWorks Controller service.

Windows Authentication: Requires HyWorks Controller service to run with user credentials. The configured user must have rights to logon as service on server and must have access to SQL server for database creation and management.

If either of the databases (Service database or Log database) is configured to use Windows authentication, HyWorks Controller service must be configured to run with user account having logon as a service rights on server.

While installing broker node, if HyWorks Controller management nodes are installed with Windows authentication, broker node will also use Windows authentication and will require to run with user account having logon as a service rights on server.

Deployment Type: Select deployment type as per your requirement and click Next. Installer wizard flow will be decided from deployment type selected at this step.

Two-node Active-Passive Cluster: Select this to deploy two-node cluster with one node working as active at a time. Choosing this option will not require cluster configuration screen, jump to step# 10 for two node deployment.
Multi-node Active-Active Cluster: Select this mode to deploy multiple HyWorks Controllers and configure with appropriate roles (management/ Broker node). Choosing this option will require administrator to set cluster configuration options.


Cluster Configuration: Choosing Deployment Type as Multi-node Active-Active Cluster Deployment, will require administrator to select Roles to install. In multi-node deployment, HyWorks Controller will be installed to function as management node or broker node and will perform role specific tasks.

Management Node: Select Roles to install as Management Node, to configure server as HyWorks Controller Management node for multi-node deployment. Management node installation will require configuring database high availability. HyWorks supports following two mechanisms:

SQL Server Managed Database High Availability: HyWorks will be configured with SQL cluster, available on single access point. Database high availability will be taken care by SQL cluster. Both HyWorks Management nodes will be pointing to same database.

HyWorks Managed Database High Availability: HyWorks will be managing database availability by syncing databases between primary and secondary HyWorks management nodes. Both management nodes will be having their own databases.

Database High Availability

Broker Node: If this server should be installed as HyWorks Controller broker node. While configuring this server as broker node, administrator will be needed to provide host address of both of the management nodes.

Broker Node Configuration: Provide information of host-address and port-number of both management nodes, e.g. mgmtsrv1:38866 or 192.168.1.1:38866. On providing management node address, broker node will automatically get database configurations and will not require database configurations. Jump to step# 11 for broker node installation.
Broker Node Configuration

Click Next and proceed to configure Service database. (Not applicable for broker nodes, jump to step# 11 for broker node installation). Configure service database appropriately using following configurations and click on next button to proceed:

Database Information: Database Server address, static TCP port to connect to SQL Server, database name.
Database Address in the format - <Server IP or FQDN>\\<SQL Instance Name>. e.g. if SQL Express is installed on the same instance then Database address could be localhost\SQLExpress for Microsoft SQL Server standard and Enterprise: localhost\MSSQLSERVER (for named instance)
Port: Provide the static port of Microsoft SQL Server e.g. 1433 (Default TCP Port for SQL Server)

Database Name: Provide the name of the database to be created. Default name is EDCDB.
Authentication mechanism: HyWorks supports following two authentication mechanism:

SQL Server Authentication. It will require SQL Server User and Password.
Windows Authentication. Use user credentials to connect to SQL Server. User credentials will be taken in next screen and will be used to run HyWorks Controller service.
Service Database Configurations as per Deployment and Node Type: Here we will try to list out database configurations to be followed for different types of deployments and node types:
Management Nodes for Two-node cluster or Multi-node cluster with HyWorks Managed Database High Availability
Both management nodes should point to different SQL servers to be configured for database.
Management Nodes for Multi-node cluster with SQL Server Managed Database High Availability
Both the management nodes must use same SQL server cluster address, port number and database name.


Important

HyWorks VM Scale Booster Configuration
After a successful installation, the following configurations should be done to enable communication between the HyWorks VM Scale Booster and the HyWorks Controller:

Locate the appsettings.json file in the Directory where the HyWorks VM Scale Booster is installed - C:\Program Files (x86)\Accops\HyWorks VM Scale Booster\appsettings.json.

Update the following tags (refer to the screenshot)

Servers

IP1: IP address of the Primary HyWorks Controller

IP2: IP address of the Secondary HyWorks Controller

RabbitMQ

Host: IP address of the RabbitMQ server

Port: If the RabbitMQ is running on a different port other than the default 5672 port

Syslog

Host IP address of the syslog server


Save appsettings.json

Restart the Accops HyWorks VM Scale Booster service

Enable VM Scale Booster on the Controller
Configuration on the HyWorks Controller
Once the HyWorks VM Scale Booster is configured and the services are running, follow the steps given below to enable the VM Scale Booster from the HyWorks Controller:

Open the HyWorks Management Console > System > Advance config

Search for the tag DVM push and make the following changes:

DVM Agent Queue Username: accopsmqadmin

Desktop Poll Mode: 2

DVM Agent Queue Hostname: IP of the RabbitMQ (in case of HA, VIP of RabbitMQ)



Save the configurations and click Update to push the changes

Configuration on the SHD
Install the latest Session Host Installer setup that has the in-built DVM Tools-Lite. The Session Host Server and the Monitoring Services will use the DVM Tools to push the service and the load status.

Limitations of the VM Scale Booster
The VM Scale Booster feature works only for Managed SHD Pools.

The VM Scale Booster feature works only for Windows Managed SHDs. Linux SHD does not support the SHD push Feature.

The HyWorks VM Scale Booster [v3.3.0.20] requires 3.3 GA or above Controller & SHD and vice versa.

Important (VM Scale Booster)
During the installation of this new Session Host, it installs a DVMTools-Lite automatically and sets the EnableShdMode registry of the Desktop Agent as True. So, if the manual is set as false, then the SHD Push will not work.

The manual installation arguments for the SHD Mode enabled DVMTools with regular release:

Argument: HyWorksDVMTools.exe /S /desktopagent=1 /hyprint=0 /usbcleaner=0 /usbredirection=0 /EnableShdMode=1
DVM push agent refresh timeout: After this timeout, only the controller-driven manual poll will be executed to each of the SessionHosts/MonitoringServers/DVMAgents.

Azure-specific configurations on the Controller
Add the following inbound firewall rules for ports:

5672: RabbitMQ Message Queue [Must]

15672: RabbitMQ Management Console [Optional]

Troubleshooting
In case of Azure, the rule needs to be added on the Network Interface via the Azure portal for port number 5672 and 15672

Check the IP address of the Controllers in appsetting.json file

Check the Username and Hostname for the RabbitMq in the Advance config section on the Management Console

Appendix
Change the default port of RabbitMQ
Controller: Update the port into MMC > Advance Config with Key[DVM Agent Queue Port]

HyWorks VM Scale Booster: Update the port[key: RabbitMQ-> Port] in the config file at

Filename: appsettings.json

Path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Accops\HyWorks VM Scale Booster

Update the RabbitMQ port at the config file:

rabbitmq-service.bat remove

rabbitmq-service.bat install

rabbitmq-service.bat start

VM Scale Booster HA Configuration
In enterprize environments, VM Scale booster must be configured to run in high availability mode. Accops does not provide any built-in load balancing or high availability of VM Scale Booster and thus the same can be achieved via 3rd party load balancer and high availability applications. One such solution is Microsoft Failover cluster manager. The below method can be used to configure MS failover cluster manager:

Note

Though the scripts/methods are provided but eventually the configurations/load balancing and failover handling is outside the scope of Accops.
After a successful installation of the Accops HyWorks VM Scale Booster, log in to both the VMs with AD Admin (both VMs should be joined to the same domain)

Copy the PowerShell script FC_Configure.ps1 locally to both the VMs

Update the configurations into the scripts [viz. Failover Cluster old/new names, hostnames & VIPs]

Run the PowerShell ISE with Admin privilege

Execute set-executionpolicy remotesigned to enable the PowerShell script execution



Open or load the script FC_Configure.ps1

Update the following tags (refer to the screenshot)

: new_FC_Name: Name of the Failover Cluster

: new_FC_RabbitMq_Name: Name of the Failover Cluster role for RabbitMq

: new_FC_DVMConsumer_Name: Name of the Failover Cluster role for the HyWorks VM Scale Booster

: HostName_1: Hostname of the first VM of the HA configuration

: HostName_1: Hostname of the Second VM of the HA configuration

: VIP_FC: Provide an available IP address for the Failover Cluster

: VIP_FCRabbitMq: Provide an available IP address for the RabbitMq role in the Failover Cluster

: VIP_FC_DVMConsumer: Provide an available IP address for the HyWorks VM Scale Booster role in the Failover Cluster



Note

The name given to the Failover cluster and roles should not be greater than 15 characters

This will enable the Failover Clustering Feature for the machine and will prompt for the Failover clustering configuration

On one VM, click No for a clean-up, if any previous Cluster Group or Role has been added

On another VM, click Yes to configure the Failover cluster [it will first cleanup the local Failover cluster, followed by configuration of the the new one]

The Failover cluster should now be configured and ready to use. Confirm that the configured Roles are visible and are running.

Update the VIP used for FC_RabbitMq in the appsettings.json file on both the machines and restart the Accops HyWorks VM Scale Booster service.

In the Failover Cluster Manager, right click FC_AccopsDvmConsumer role > Move > Select Node > (Select another node) Ok

For the FC_RabbitMq role, the same steps as the ones mentioned above should be executed.

The system should now be ready to use, and will automatically switch the VIP in case of service failure, allowing the DVMs to push to only one RabbitMQ server using the VIP.

Standalone SCVMM Server Deployment
For installation of the Hyper-V Connector on SCVMM server, the installation process is the same as described in the Hyper-V section, except for step 10.a where the module to be selected must be the SCVMM server.



Clustered SCVMM Server Deployment
For a SCVMM Cluster environment, installation and configuration should be done under the supervision of the Accops team. For installation in a SCVMM cluster environment, the installation process will remain the same except that the Cluster Deployment option must be selected.



Installation Logs
HyWorks installation logs can be used for troubleshooting and verification purposes. Installation logs are created at the following location:

<Hyper-V Installation Directory>\Hyper-V Connector\Logs, e.g.
C:\Program Files\Accops\HyWorks\Hyper-V Connector\Logs




Enhanced USB Redirection
SEP (Enhanced USB Redirection Driver) suite or components are used when Enhanced USB redirection driver is used in HyWorks.

SEP is recommended for a shared desktop environment as it supports isolation of the USB devices and does not share the devices in all the running session.

Note

USB redirection through enhanced driver is controlled from the SEP license server. Therefore, all the DVMs should have the SEPAPP (SEP Server Module) configured with the appropriate SEP license server.

The license server should have appropriate policies configured for USB redirection.

Enhanced USB redirection requires extra licensing cost.

<Hyper-V Installation Directory>\Hyper-V Connector\Logs, e.g.
C:\Program Files\Accops\HyWorks\Hyper-V Connector\Logs


Troubleshooting
Installation Wizard should not be left unattended
HyPrint Installation Confirmation
During installation for the first time, setup may display confirmation dialog for the installation of HyPrint module and the setup will not proceed until it is being confirmed by user.

Thus, Installation wizard should not be left unattended else it may wait for user confirmation and will not proceed.

Session Host or Monitoring Service Not Getting Started During installation
Sometimes on slow servers, the services being installed with HyWorks Session Host Server i.e. (Session Host Service and HyWorks Monitoring Service) does not get started in a timely manner during installation and thus the error is displayed.

The error can be ignored, and services can be started post installation but if the setup is left unattended the setup will not proceed until the administrator acknowledges the error by clicking on OK button and thus the setup should not be left unattended.

Error 'Appropriate .Net application pool in the IIS (NOT FOUND)'
The error is displayed while installing Accops HyWorks Management Console, though .Net 4.5 has been installed and ASP.Net is enabled in Windows Server 2008 R2 machine.



During fresh installation, while selecting component 'Accops HyWorks Management Console' error is displayed.

RESOLUTION

Start -> Command Prompt

Right click on it and select \"Run as Administrator\"

'cd' to desired .Net 4.0 installation folder: Default path is:

cd Windows\Microsoft.Net\Framework64\v4.0.30319
